        <h3>How do we monitor integrity?</h3>
        <p><strong>On-line identification tools </strong>are used to compare work submitted to information available on the internet as well as to all prior assessments submitted by all students.</p>
        <p><strong>Discussion-Based Assessments</strong> are conducted routinely between the instructor and the student. These must be completed free of any distraction or influence from others. This is also a time to ask your instructor questions.</p>
        <p><strong>Proctored exams </strong>are a routine part of how we ensure student learning is taking place. These include randomly selected students. Refusal to take a proctored exam at any time will result in a failing grade in the course.</p>
