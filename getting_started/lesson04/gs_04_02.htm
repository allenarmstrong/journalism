        <h3>Choose your collaboration.</h3>
        <p>Throughout this  course, you will have opportunities to collaborate with your fellow classmates. You are required to submit one collaboration assessment in each <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span>. If you choose to collaborate more than once, you will earn credit for only one collaboration activity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Synchronous</strong> collaboration: Contact your instructor to learn about collaboration opportunities that will allow you to interact with your classmates online, in real-time, using Web 2.0 tools. If you choose to participate in the synchronous collaboration opportunity, your instructor will explain what you need to submit for grading.</li>
          <li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> collaboration: You have the opportunity to participate in an asynchronous collaboration with one of your classmates. To participate in this collaboration, use the discussion board and/or email feature of the course to send a message to your classmates to find a peer review partner. Once you have found someone to work with, you will send your writing, and your classmate will review it using the Guide for Peer Review provided in the lesson.</li>
