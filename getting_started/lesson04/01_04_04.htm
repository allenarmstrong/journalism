        <h3>Types of Assessments (continued)</h3>
        <h4>Project-Based Submission</h4>
        <p>A project-based submission is an <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span> that has several steps and requires research. Be sure to look over the rubric and check the quality of your work before you submit each <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>.</p>
        <h4>Discussion-Based Assessments</h4>
        <p>Discussion-Based Assessments are conducted routinely between the instructor and the student. These must be completed free of any distraction, or influence from others. This is also a time to ask your instructor questions.</p>
