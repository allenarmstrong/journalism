    <p>Please contact your instructor to complete your Discussion-Based Assessment. You and your instructor will have a conversation based on the material you have learned in <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> one to ensure you are ready to move on. </p>
    <p>Take a few minutes to look over the <a href="pop/dba_rubric.htm" class="pop" data-mwidth="90%" data-mheight="90%">grading rubric</a> and get cozy with the criteria your instructor will be using to grade you. Trust usâ€”the better you know the rubric, the better you will do!</p>
    <p>Think about any questions you still have about the material in this unit; this conversation is a great time to ask your instructor these questions.</p>
