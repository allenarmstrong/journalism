			<p>In the American colonies, British authorities shut down several controversial publications for printing news that the leaders of the colonies didn't want to see in papers. </p>
    	<p>As a result, many of the earliest colonial newspapers simply focused on inoffensive, local details, such as suggestions for housekeeping and notices about weddings, births, and deaths. There are some accounts of publishers printing controversial information with severe consequences.</p>

		<p>John Peter Zenger, in 1734, was arrested and stood trial for running an article in <em>The New-York Weekly Journal</em> that was critical of the governor of New York. Zenger was later acquitted, and his trial remains an important piece of early journalism history.</p>

		<p>One other important difference to note is the way early American newspapers mixed <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Editorial:</strong> Opinion-based" data-position="top">editorial</span> content with the news. Today's readers want to know whether they are reading biased or impartial stories, and they expect reporters to be up front about the difference.</p>
		<p>American newspapers not only looked different years ago; they were made differently. The supplies needed to create a small newspaper were quite expensive, and printers often produced only a few hundred copies per run.</p>

			<p>To print newspapers in the 1700s, publishers had to use a specific form of typesetting. This process required hand-placing individual pieces of inked metal with letters and numbers on them facing backward, as if they were a mirror image of the newspaper. This string of backward letters created the words that people would later read at home. Imagine how much longer it took early Americans to create just one newspaperâ€”up to 16 hours for just four pages!</p>
