<h1>American Revolution </h1>
<p>When the American Revolution began, readers’ desires shifted. Feeling a need to stay informed about the war, many readers demanded more information about Britain and other related events. Newspapers provided much of this information, and several publications came out in favor of independence, furthering public support for the war.</p>
<p>When America became an independent country and established the First Amendment to the Constitution, members of the press became free to take one side or the other—or none at all—in their reporting of events. In essence, the government protected the press from the government itself. This was an important step in establishing a democracy of the people. </p>
