<h1>Helpful Hints</h1><img src="../images/cloud_ts.jpg" width="248" height="383" alt="Image of clouds" class="pull-right flush-top"><h2> Context</h2>  When you see a word you don’t understand, pay close attention to the words around it. Very often, you can figure out the meaning of the new word by seeing what it has to do with the rest of the sentence or paragraph.
 <p><em>Here’s an example:</em><br/>
    The cold wind blew through a fissure in the wall, chilling everyone inside the room.</p>
  <p>If you didn’t know the meaning of the word <strong>fissure</strong>, what would you do? You could go look it up, or you could try to figure it out through context. Look at the sentence below to see how context works. </p>


<a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="I can tell the wind is going through the fissure. And the fissure appears to be in the wall of a building, like a house. The people inside can feel the cold wind because of the fissure. This means the fissure must be a crack in the wall!" data-title="" data-trigger="hover"><em><strong>The cold wind blew through a fissure in the wall, chilling everyone inside the room.</strong></em></a>

  <h2>Word Choice</h2>
  <p>Notice how important the other words were in this sentence. The author described a “cold wind” that was “chilling everyone,” and you knew that the wind was getting “inside the room.” An author’s word choice can really set the scene for you to understand what’s happening as well as figure out words in context.</p>
    <p>Keep this in mind when you’re writing your own news stories. Your audience will thank you. </p><div class="clearfix"></div>
