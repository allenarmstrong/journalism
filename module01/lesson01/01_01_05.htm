For example, “symbolic expression” is also protected by the First Amendment. This means that forms of expression that do not include speech, such as demonstrations, may also fall under the protection of the freedom of speech.</p>

<p>In addition, courts have had to establish buffer zones in some situations, requiring protesters to stay a certain distance from the event they are protesting. This and other restrictions are established to <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Diminish</strong>: Reduce" data-position="top">diminish</span> the chance of violence during protests.</p>
