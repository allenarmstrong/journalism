   <h1>The First Amendment</h1>

  <p>The First Amendment makes the American press possible. Take a look at the Constitution. Does the Bill of Rights protect any private business? It protects just one: <strong>journalism</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Journalists do not work for the government, but they are protected by it. </p>

  <p>Here are the words that established freedom of the press:</p>


  <img src="images/01_03_03_newlg_constitution_ts.png" 
	alt="Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." data-width="" id="img_pad">


  <p>Some of the words of the First Amendment may be confusing to you. Don't worry! There's an easy way to make sense of it all. Journalists use this trick all the time. It's known as <strong>context</strong> and <strong>word choice</strong>. </p>

 <h4>Look at the First Amendment Again:</h4>
<blockquote>
 <p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or <a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="This whole amendment seems to list things Congress can't stop us from doing. Prohibiting must mean preventing!" data-title="" data-trigger="hover"><em><strong>prohibiting</strong></em></a> the free exercise thereof; or <a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="Because this amendment is about what Congress can't stop us from doing, this part must mean they can't make a law that restricts or destroys our freedom or speech or the press. Abridging must mean making smaller!" data-title="" data-trigger="hover"><em><strong>abridging</strong></em></a> the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a <a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="This says people must be allowed to petition the government, or write a request to the government, about their grievances or problemsâ€š why would they want to do this? People usually write complaints because they want some kind of resolution or repayment. So redress must mean correction or compensation!" data-title="" data-trigger="hover"><strong><em>redress</em></strong></a>

  of grievances.</p>

 </blockquote> 

  <p>Democracy exists based on the decisions of the American people. The news reports on, among other things, which politicians are running for office and what politicians are doing or not doing while in office. So why would the Founding Fathers add an amendment assuring the right of the press to keep watch over the government? What do you think?</p>

  <p>One of the most important pillars of freedom is the freedom to be informed, according to our Founding Fathers. This was so important to them that they believed it should be placed in our Constitution, even though it meant that they themselves would be watched closely by the press.</p>

      <p>Benjamin Franklin published more than one newspaper. In the mid-1700s, he circulated a popular annual publication called <em>Poor Richard's Almanack</em>. The success and high sales of this publication helped Franklin achieve success in other areas in his life.</p>

      data-copyright="Public Domain"><p><em>Poor Richard's Almanack</em> was an early example of the American public's desire to be informed.</p><br/>

 <p>Similar to a modern newspaper, <em>Poor Richard's Almanack</em> contained a variety of things the readers were interested in. At the time, this included weather reports, puzzles, proverbs or suggestions, and other tips for living in the colonies.</p>

  <p>Though the information included in Benjamin Franklin's publication may seem <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Antiquated:</strong> Old" data-position="top">antiquated</span> to us now, it covered topics of interest to the readers at the time. Today, the demand for 24-hour news networks and websites proves that the desire to be informed has not faded.</p>

  

  

  <p>American journalism has come a long way, and it has changed significantly over time. It has grown from pamphlets to computer screens and changed from primarily subjective reporting to both <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Subjective:</strong> Opinionated" data-position="top">subjective</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Objective:</strong> Without opinion" data-position="top">objective</span> reporting, as you will see in the rest of this module.</p>

    <p>However, one thing has remained the same: the American public's interest in news.</p>
