     <br/> <p>Journalists are most concerned with the “freedom of speech, or of the press” section of the First Amendment, as it applies directly to their work. Without a protection established for freedom of the press, journalists could not freely report what is happening in the world around them. Imagine if you lived in an era when no one could tell you what was going on in your government or the world!</p>

<p>Without the important information that the press provides, few people would have the time or resources to investigate what is going on in the world around them. In 2010, the residents of a small city in California learned just how serious that problem can be.</p><div class="clearfix"></div>

       class="pull-right top-flush" data-copyright="2010 AP images"> <p>The people of Bell, California make an average of $35,000 a year. In 2010, the city manager was arrested when it was discovered that his salary was almost $800,000 a year. That is nearly $400,000 more than the president of the United States makes. Several officials were arrested and charged with misappropriation of funds. When the story hit the news, many residents were outraged—they had not known about this problem.</p>

<p>The story about Bell, California, is just one example of how important the need for journalists is. The constitutional protection of the press allows journalists to devote their time and energy to observing and reporting what goes on around them. This allows readers to understand what their elected officials are doing, even when the officials themselves might prefer that nobody find out.</p><div class="clearfix"></div>
