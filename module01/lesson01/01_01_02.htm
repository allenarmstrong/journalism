  <h1>The History of Journalism</h1>
  <p>Do you use a computer to type your papers? What would you do if your delete key was broken? What would you do if you had to write everything you ever turned in by hand? What if your instructor required several handwritten copies of every paper you ever wrote?</p>
  <p>Journalism has come a long way since its beginnings in America. </p>

<h1>Early American Journalism</h1>

  <p>Early journalism was more difficult to create than it is today. Many of the first publications had to be put together by hand, with each letter being placed on a sheet one by one. If you had to do your homework the way journalists created the earliest newspapers, it would take you much longer to get things done!</p>
  <p>Today most journalists use computers to complete their reports. They also can use the Internet and telephone to deliver important information over long distances. Imagine what it must have been like to not have a delete key, or to not know what was happening in the other parts of the country or world!</p>
