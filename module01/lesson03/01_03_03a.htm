      data-copyright="Public Domain"><p>In the late 1800s and early 1900s, people had developed such an interest in news that it became possible to make a huge fortune as a publisher or editor in the journalism industry. One notable person to do this was William Randolph Hearst. </p>
    
    <p>William Randolph Hearst made his fortune through <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Sensationalizing:</strong> Making exciting without regard for the truth" data-position="top">sensationalizing</span> journalism. He took over several publications and showed more of an interest in sales than in credibility. Many of his newspapers <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Exploited:</strong> Used for profit" data-position="top">exploited</span> stories to make them seem more sensational than they were in reality. This practice led to what became known as <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Yellow Journalism:</strong> Irresponsible reporting in an attempt to get more readers" data-position="top">yellow journalism</span>. </p>
    
    <p>In 1941, actor and director Orson Welles released a fictional exposé of the publishing industry, <em>Citizen Kane</em>. The film depicted a publisher much like William Randolph Hearst. 
    <br/>
    <p>By the 1950s, many homes in the United States had at least one television, and the demand for regular news updates grew. In the 1980s, media tycoon Ted Turner invested in Cable News Network, or CNN. This became the first channel to provide 24-hour news coverage. </p>
    <p>Billionaire Rupert Murdoch became a household name as he built his media empire through the acquisition of several companies. As CEO of News Corporation, Murdoch came to own Fox News, the <em>New York Post</em> newspaper, HarperCollins Publishers, the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios, MySpace, and many other media sources.</p>
    <h1>Journalism's Gatekeepers</h1><p>In such a thriving industry, it is not uncommon for journalists themselves to become famous. The people and companies that have dedicated their careers to bringing important information to the public are known as journalism’s “gatekeepers.” In other words, these are trained and educated professionals who work for organizations that hold them accountable for bringing quality news to the public. </p><p>Check out this slideshow to learn interesting facts about some of the most well-known Gatekeepers.</p>

	<h1>Who Are the Gatekeepers Now?</h1>
    
    <p>With the rapid advancement of technology, more and more people are able to participate in the spreading of news. Suddenly it’s not only the trained and educated journalists who provide information; now anyone with an online connection can let the world know what is happening in his or her area in just moments. </p>
   <img src="images/01_03_03_tweetSm_ts.png" 
	alt="Image twitter-esque feed that reads “This just in: JK Rowling plagiarized Harry Potter from Disney’s film Frozen!”" 
	class="pull-right top-flush" 
    data-width=""> <p>In many ways, this is an exciting time because it means news can spread faster and more easily than ever before. However, it is also a time of <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Rampant:</strong> Spreading quickly without anyone checking it" data-position="top">rampant</span> misinformation because we often don’t know which sources we can trust. In a world where anyone can post news online, who will make sure the “facts” are true? </p>
    
    

	<p>As you have seen in this lesson, advances in technology have led to many changes in modern American journalism: </p>
