					<h2>Photojournalism</h2>
    <p>Wartime has always been important for journalism. People want to know how their loved ones in the service are doing, and they want to know why their leaders are sending them to fight. Reporters make it their job to find answers to these questions and bring back accurate news to the readers, listeners, and viewers at home.<br/><br/>
    Many news consumers debate whether reporters should run stories that reflect wars in a negative light. Some believe the public has the right to know even the most painful details of battle, while others feel that unhappy news about war lowers the morale of the country.<br/><br/>The Civil War marked an important change in the history of American journalism. Not only did reporters follow the battles and write about what had happened on the front lines for the first time, but photographers contributed images that became some of the first examples of <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Photojournalism:</strong> Photography that documents the news" data-position="top">photojournalism</span> in America. <br/><br/>Today, photojournalism continues to be a major source of our news. Though pictures themselves do not convey all the information needed, they help readers understand what is going on in their communities and throughout the world.</p>

					<h2>Radio</h2>
					<p>Radio broadcast news provides a voice to accompany the stories, but no pictures. This means that reporters on the radio have to <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Enunciate:</strong> Pronounce words clearly" data-position="top">enunciate</span> and describe events in vivid detail. In the early days of radio reporting, people often gathered around their radios to listen to the evening news each day. Today, the radio still reports about current events, weather, traffic updates, and other topics.</p>

					<h2>Television</h2>
					<p>Television provides voice and video to cover the news, but not written stories. This means that reporters on television must look professional and describe events clearly alongside video clips of news as it happens. Television still provides the news in many forms today. </p>
