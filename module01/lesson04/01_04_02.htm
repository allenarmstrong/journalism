  <h1>Who Are Journalists?</h1>
  <p>There are many different ideas about what a journalist actually is. So how do you know the difference between a journalist and a nonjournalist? </p>
  <p>There is one basic difference that is a perfect starting point: <strong>Journalists inform people about what is going on around them</strong>.</p>
  <p>Beyond that, the definition becomes more difficult to pin down. </p>
  
  <p>The government requires licenses for many professions to make sure people know how to do what they say they can do.</p>
  <strong> Examples:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>A doctor must obtain licensing to practice medicine. </li>
    <li>A lawyer has to pass the state bar exam.</li>
    <li>A hairstylist takes a licensing exam.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, the government does not license journalists. </p>
  <p>Although there are many professional journalism schools that help students improve their chances to get hired, journalism school is not required by law. In effect, anyone who wants to can become a journalist. </p>

  <h3>Journalists in Television</h3>
  <p>Many people imagine traditional news anchors when they think of journalists. These journalists work for companies that often have established fact-checking rules and codes of ethics that each member of the news staff must follow. </p>
  <p>Today, news anchors report on the news, as well as interview on-the-scene reporters about events. Often, they make their stories appropriate for both television and online audiences. They have full-time jobs with their stations and often remain journalists throughout their entire careers.</p><br/>

<p>These journalists work for companies that normally have established fact-checking rules and codes of ethics that each member of the news staff must follow. Today’s newspaper reporters seek out, research, and report on the news, often making their stories appropriate for the printed newspaper, as well as for newspaper-run television stations and online websites. They have full-time jobs with their newspapers and often remain journalists throughout their entire careers.</p><br/>
