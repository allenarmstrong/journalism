<h1>Speaker Confidence - Text Version</h1>

<p>Drag the items below to the scene  to see how they can improve the speaker's confidence.</p>





<p><em>The presentation begins by showing  a scene with a man. He is standing at the front of a room with people sitting around a table, looking at him. He is dressed in jeans and a pull-over sweater, his hands are in his pockets, and he is looking to the side of the room, avoiding eye contact with other&nbsp;people in the presentation.</em></p>
