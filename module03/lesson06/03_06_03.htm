<h1>Public Speaking Skills</h1>
<p>When you present your feature story, you must take several things into consideration. Public speaking skills will help you make a great presentation. </p>
<p>Here are some important tips for being a strong public speaker and giving a strong presentation:</p>

<div class="panel-group" id="accordion">

      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseTwo">
            <h4 class="panel-title">Body Language</h4>
      </div>

        <div class="panel-body">
       
           <ul>
             <li><strong>Make eye contact if you can be seen. </strong>It’s fine to glance at your notes occasionally, but relaxed eye contact makes people comfortable with you and shows your confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Keep good posture.</strong> Don’t slouch, hide your hands, or face away from your audience. This can make you look uninviting or nervous. </li>
<li><strong>Be careful with gestures.</strong> A moderate amount of hand movement is fine, but it can be distracting or even offensive if you make frequent gestures. Movements, such as playing with your hair, can make you appear uncomfortable with the situation.</li></ul>

         <ul><li><strong>Articulate.</strong> Make sure your audience can hear every word you say. No one should have to rewind your presentation to figure out what you were saying.</li> 
<li><strong>Watch your pace.</strong> Listen to yourself as you speak. Many people speed up when they’re nervous, making their speech get lost in a series of mumbled words. Take your time. </li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to your volume. </strong>For a recorded presentation, it’s important to view your work before you share it with your instructor. Can you be heard throughout the entire piece? Are you too loud? </li></ul>

           <ul><li><strong>Dress appropriately.</strong> You want to be comfortable in your clothes while still looking professional. </li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to your audience.</strong> If you’re giving a live presentation, make sure you know whether your audience is reacting to what you say. This will help you adjust your presentation as you go. </li>
<li><strong>Be aware of time.</strong> Lots of people are pretty surprised to realize they’ve gone over or under time. Practice your presentation to make sure you have it just right. </li></ul>
