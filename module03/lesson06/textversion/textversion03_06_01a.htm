  <li>Reporting interviews - Correct.<br />

  This is often done over the phone or in person. It requires you to speak clearly, respectfully, and professionally, and to build upon what the other person is saying.</li>

  <li>Job interviews - Correct.<br />

  This is often done in person. It requires you to speak clearly, respectfully, and professionally, and to build upon what the other person is saying.</li>

  <li>Broadcast news - Correct.<br />

  This is similar to public speaking, in that you will need to speak into a microphone or to a camera about the news that is happening. Your demeanor must be professional, and you must be able to speak clearly and with confidence.</li>

  <li>Press conferences - Correct.<br />

  This is a situation where you may need to ask interview questions in front of a large group of people. Because you are always representing your organization when you work in the public, you will need to take special care to present yourself as a professional, respectful individual.</li>

  <li>Leading teams - Correct.<br />

  This may be an editor position or another managerial career. Many positions in journalism require leadership skills in order to direct news teams. For this, you will need to be able to share information as well as listen actively to what team members have to say. A respectful, professional attitude is necessary.</li>
