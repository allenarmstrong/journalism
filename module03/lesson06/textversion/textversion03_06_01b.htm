<h1>Speaker Confidence - Text Version</h1>

<p>Drag the items below to the scene  to see how they can improve the speaker's confidence.</p>





<p><em>The presentation begins by showing  a scene with a man. He is standing at the front of a room with people sitting around a table, looking at him. He is dressed in jeans and a pull-over sweater, his hands are in his pockets and is looking to the side of the room, avoiding eye contact with other&nbsp;people in the presentation.</em></p>

    <div class="panel-body">
     
      <p>Know your stuff<br />

                        <em>When the presentation material is dragged onto the table the speaker is shown. He is dressed in jeans and a pull-over sweater, his arms are crossed and he is looking slightly toward the crowd. He knows his material and is confident in his work.</em></p>

                        <em>When the water is dragged onto the table the speaker is shown. He is still dressed in jeans and a pull-over sweater but has unfolded his arms they are now at his side. He is more confident now.</em></p>

                        <em>When the business suit is dragged onto the speaker he is shown dressed in the suit. He looks professional and confident, his arms are at his sides as he presents. He has a slight slouch and you may wonder if he is still nervous.</em></p>

One person is holding a stuffed teddy bear. The speaker is smiling at the crowd, has a good posture and appears very confident.</em></p>
