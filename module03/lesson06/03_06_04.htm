<h1>Overcoming Fear</h1>
<p>Many people fear public speaking more than anything else. If this describes how you feel, remember that you’re not alone! It’s fairly common for presenters to get nervous before they record something or talk to groups of people.</p>
<p>Let’s review a few strategies for alleviating the fears associated with public speaking. </p>

<!-- Begin Interactive - Confidence drag and drop --> 
<div class="interactive" data-src="interactives/03_06_01_dd1/index.html:600:480" data-textversion="interactives/03_06_01_dd1/textversion.htm" ></div>   
<!-- End Interactive --> 
<div class="clearfix"></div><br/>
<p>If you’re already comfortable with public speaking, good for you! You have learned what is true: As long as you prepare ahead of time and act like yourself, things are bound to go well.</p>
<p>If you aren’t comfortable with public speaking yet, don’t worry! People face this fear every single day—and many people have taken complete control over it. You can, too. All it takes is some practice. </p>
