  <h1>Final Draft</h1>
  <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You have planned, researched, and written a first draft of your feature story. That’s an amazing accomplishment!
  <p>Now it’s time to revise your work. Your final draft should show major revision changes from your first draft, and it will be a much better product.</p>
  <div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseTwo">

      </div>
      <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Your first draft was the structured collection of your ideas for a feature story. There were probably some errors, but you corrected many of them. In your first draft, your thoughts may not have flowed together as smoothly as you would have liked, but you included your research, interviews, descriptive details, and anecdotes to get your message across.</p>

          <p>Think of your final draft as the publishable revision of your first draft. There should be no errors, and your thoughts should flow together as smoothly as possible. You will use effective transitions and word choices to show your reader what is happening. </p>
          <p>Even though you’ve made revisions throughout the writing process, this is the stage where you should make the strongest choices to revise and improve your work.</p>

  <h1>The Finishing Touches</h1>
  Your next steps will be to revise and edit your work. As you can see below, revision is a much more involved process than editing.

      <figcaption>
        <h2>Main &nbsp; Idea</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Your story should include a clear "human interest" element that is the focus of your writing.</p> 
          <p>Check every time you have quoted someone, described something, or referred to your research.</p>
          <p>Every single reference should relate to the main idea of your story.</p>
          <p>If there's anything that seems even slightly irrelevant, remove it for something that sticks to the topic.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Read your lead and your conclusion again to make sure they're as engaging as possible.</p>
          <p>They should both set and maintain an appropriate tone for the story.</p>
          <p>Your lead should get your readers interested, and your conclusion should reflect upon where you started. </p>

        <h2>Transitions</h2>
        <div>
          <p>It's important to use logical transitions between your ideas to show how they're connected.</p>
          <p>Every time you're moving to a new thought,
          use a transition to keep things moving in a logical order.</p>

      <figcaption>
        <h2>Descriptions</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Your readers want to visualize what you're writing about.</p>
          <p>Check for important people, places, and events mentioned in your story
         and make sure they have been described so readers can really "see" them in their minds.  </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Adjectives &nbsp; and &nbsp; Adverbs</h2>
        <div>
          <p>In fiction, it's often useful to include adjectives and adverbs, describing the "beautiful flower" rather than the flower.</p>
          <p>However, in feature writing, this is considered less useful. Readers want to make up their minds on their own.</p>
          <p>Tell them what kind of flower it was&#8212;perhaps an orchid or a rose&#8212;but let them decide from factual details whether it was beautiful.</p>
          <p>In other words, leave out unnecessary adjectives and adverbs.</p>
        </div>

      <figcaption >
        <h2>Sentence &nbsp; Structure</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Read your sentences. Do you have several short ones that could be combined?</p>
          <p>Do you have several long thoughts in a row that should be broken up?</p>
          <p>Readers like to see variety in your sentence structure.</p> 
          <p>That's a key to good writing. Give it a try in your revisions!</p>

  <p><strong>Revising</strong> requires you to look at your writing in a different way to see what can be improved.</p>
  <p><strong>Editing</strong> is the final step in the process, where you go back to correct any conventions errors: spelling, grammar, capitalization, and punctuation. </p>
  <p>Both steps are extremely important to the strength of your final draft!</p>
