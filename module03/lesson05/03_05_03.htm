<h1>Revising</h1>
Let’s start with revision. There are several things you should examine in your first draft to create the best final draft possible:

<div id="clipboard">
    <div>
      <p>Do all examples of research, interview quotations, and descriptive anecdotes relate to your main topic?
        </p>
      <p>Is the lead interesting and engaging?
        </p>
      <p>Does the story include a clear "human interest" element to keep readers going?
      </p>
      <p>Does the story have a clear beginning, middle, and end?
        </p>
      <p>Are temporal words or phrases used to transition writing from one idea to the next?
        </p>
      <p>Does the story move from beginning to end in a logical order?</p>
      <p>Are vivid descriptions used to add interest to your story?</p>
      <p>Do the tone and mood fit the topic selected?</p>
      <p>Are the tone and mood consistent throughout the story? <em>*Tip: Read the draft aloud to check for sentence fluency. Any parts that sound awkward should be revised.</em></p>
      <p>Are the sentences varied in length and structure?</p>
            <p>Have you used "action" verbs? </p>
      <p>Can any short sentences be improved by combining them?</p>
      <p>Can any long sentences be made more concise?</p>
      <p>Are relevant and interesting lines from your interviews incorporated in your story?</p>
      <p>Have you removed unnecessary adjectives and adverbs from your sentences? </p>
    </div>

<h1>Editing	</h1>
<p>Even the smallest errors&#8212;such as typos or grammatical problems&#8212;can harm your credibility as a journalist. People are much more willing to trust you when your writing isn’t filled with mistakes! </p>

<p>Once you have revised your writing, it is time to edit. Look for errors in grammar, structure, and punctuation.</p>
