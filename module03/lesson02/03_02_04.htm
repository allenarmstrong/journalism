      <p>A feature story should read like a narrative. Though you aren't writing fiction, you are still trying to tell an interesting story. This means you must help readers really "see" the images you're trying to describe.</p> 
	  <p>Whenever possible, use descriptive details to get your message across.</p>
      <p>"Irene couldn't live without her game console."</p>
      <p>This is a pretty average, boring sentence. You might also be curious about why Irene can't live without her game console. </p>
      <p>Consider this sentence instead: "Irene couldn't live without her game console, the electric box of endless entertainment." Inserting the descriptive phrase makes the sentence more interesting and provides more information about Irene's game console.</p> 
      <p>"Game console" can also be eliminated from the sentence, and it will still make sense: "Irene couldn't live without her electric box of endless entertainment."</p>

    <p>To combine simple sentences and phrases, you need a link. That link is most often a subordinate conjunction. Some commonly used subordinate conjunctions are:</p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped">
		<caption>
		Words that link sentences.
		</caption>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>After</td>
				<td>Although</td>
				<td>As</td>
				<td>Because</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Before</td>
				<td>Even if</td>
				<td>Even though</td>
				<td>If</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Once</td>
				<td>So that</td>
				<td>Than</td>
				<td>That</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Though</td>
				<td>Unless</td>
				<td>Until</td>
				<td>When</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Whenever</td>
				<td>Where</td>
				<td>Whether</td>
				<td>While</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
    
    <p>See how these subordinate conjunctions improve the flow of sentences.</p>

    <p>One problem feature writers face is transitions. You have to link your ideas together so they make sense, but they should still be interesting. How do you do this?</p>
	<p>In a narrative, writers use transitions known as temporal clues. These are transitions that bring your reader through the story from the beginning to the end.</p>
	<p>Use a temporal transition when you have:</p>
		<ul>
        	<li>a change in the setting</li>
			<li>a change in the action</li>
			<li>a change in a person's emotions or thoughts</li>
        </ul>
   
    <p>The trick is to try to make these transitions sound interesting. Use descriptive phrases in your transitions whenever possible to keep your writing sounding like a feature story rather than a list of events.</p>

      	<p>Descriptive writing means being specific. One important way to be specific is to include direct quotations from people you have interviewed.</p> 
        <p>There is a common rule that writers follow: </p>
        <h4>Show. Don't tell.</h4>
        <p>Sometimes it's better to let your interviewees speak for themselves. Including direct quotations in your story can allow the reader to visualize what really happened. </p>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tab5">
      	<div class="well default">Details are good. Details provide information. They can also help you imagine things. Details about a car can help you imagine a car. Details about a house can help you imagine a house. Using details can help you picture what's going on.</div>
		<p>Wow. That's one boring paragraph, huh? This writer should try using variety. </p>
		<p>Sentences are the building blocks writers use to construct their storiesâ€”the more varied the sentences, the more interesting the story.</p>
		<p>Short, choppy sentences can be boring and monotonous. Try spicing your writing up with some interesting information, and use what you know about combining sentences to come up with different structures. </p>
		<div class="well default">Details that provide information are great because they help you imagine things. What kind of things? How about a fast car that roars as it speeds by, or an old house with the shingles falling off the roof? See how details can help you picture what's going on? </div>
		<p>Ah. Much better. This paragraph tells the same information, but it uses variety in its sentence structure. You aren't looking at the same "this does this, and that does that" sentence over and over again!</p>
