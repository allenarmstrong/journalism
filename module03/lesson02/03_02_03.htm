The common portion reads “false and harmful information about another person” and “injury to reputation”
LIBEL reads “printed” “words” “pictures” “cartoons” “public hatred” “shame” “disgrace” “ridicule” “induce an ill opinion of a person” (should cite The Associated Press Libel Manual)
SLANDER reads “usually oral” “defamation of character” “without written words or images” “rude gestures” “spoken defamation”" class="normal">
<h2>Slander and Libel in Journalism </h2>
<p>Because journalists sometimes have to report about people in unflattering ways, journalists occasionally face accusations of slander or libel. As a result, people who work in the news industry must be careful about how they represent the subjects they cover. Otherwise, they may find themselves in the middle of a lawsuit!

      <p>Public figures, such as celebrities and politicians, must prove that there was specific <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Malice:</strong> Desire to cause harm" data-position="top">malice</span> in the reporting before they can win a slander or libel case. In other words, the public figure must show that the reporter deliberately distorted the truth in order to defame his or her character. Average people, however, can simply prove that the reporter or news organization was <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Negligent:</strong> Careless" data-position="top">negligent</span>.</p>

As you work on your feature story, you must consider the details very carefully before you report potentially damaging information about a person. Remember that it’s best to act ethically at all times. Though you may want to publish insulting or harmful information about someone you dislike, you must consider whether that would be truly reporting the news as it is or whether it would be a conflict of interest.</p>

        <p class="text-primary">Suppose you are a reporter who is covering a crime. Do you think it is slanderous or libelous to run the name of a suspect who has not yet been charged with the crime? This is a question that many journalists face as details of a crime get released. The police may feel confident that they know who did it, but they have not yet gathered enough evidence to make an arrest. Some members of the police force may even give you a tip about the suspected identity of the criminal, though no charges have been placed. Should you run the name of the suspect?

        <p class="text-primary">It is a risk to suggest that a specific person is responsible for a crime unless that person has been charged. If it turns out that the suspect did not commit the crime, then you do not have truth on your side, and the person may have a case against you. The safest thing to do is to report only what you know to be true.

        <p class="text-primary">Suppose you are a reporter who is covering the same crime. Do you think it is slanderous or libelous to run the name of the victim of the crime? This is a question that many journalists face as details of a crime get released. The victim has already been through an unhappy event in his or her life, and attention from the media may only make matters more uncomfortable. Some members of the community may believe that you should keep this information private. Should you run the name of the victim?

        <p class="text-primary">While many news organizations will refrain from identifying rape victims in particular, the identity of a victim accusing someone else of a crime is public knowledge and legal to report. It is an ethical question that reporters must consider in order to determine whether the publicity will further harm the victim. As opposed to the treatment of other crimes, most news organizations have policies about identifying people who <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>purport</strong>: claim" data-position="top">purport</span> to be victims of sexual assault.
