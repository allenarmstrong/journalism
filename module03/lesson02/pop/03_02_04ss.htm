	<h1>Sentence Structure</h1>

<p>In addition to using a good vocabulary when you write, another important part of writing and reading involves being able to understand sentence structure.</p>

<p>A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. A sentence is made up of a subject and a verb.</p>

<p>In our writing, we can use different structures for variety. We also need to avoid certain structures to keep our meaning clear. Select each of the following structures to learn more.</p>
<div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseTwo">
            <h4 class="panel-title">Independent Clauses</h4>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          
           <p><strong>Independent clauses</strong> are full thoughts that do not need anything else in order to convey a message.
Examples:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>
               I went to the beach.</li>
<li>               The author uses metaphors.</li>
           <li>    Summer is my favorite season.             </li>
           </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div> <!--End item #1-->
    
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseThree">
            <h4 class="panel-title">Dependent Clauses</h4>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
         
           <p>A <strong>dependent clause </strong>is a sentence fragment because it includes a subject and a verb but does not express a complete thought. The thought is left unfinished. It cannot stand on its own.</p>

<p>When I read the <a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="Notice that you could not simply say 'When I read the book' and stop there if you want people to understand your thought. This is a dependent clause because it depends on other words for the message to make sense." data-title="" data-trigger="hover">book</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some other examples of dependent clauses that need other words added to make sense.</p>

<p>After I went to the beach.</p>
<p>Though I was looking forward to my favorite season, summer.</p>

<div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseFour">
            <h4 class="panel-title">Sentence Fragments</h4>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          
           <p>A <strong>sentence fragment</strong> is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It is missing either the subject, the verb, or both the subject and verb.
Examples:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Fragment: Such as comic books, magazine articles, and films.</strong> <br/>
<strong>Correction:</strong> Spiderman has been adapted to many different areas <strong>such as comic books, magazine articles, and films.</strong> </li>

<li><strong>Fragment: Because I was hungry.</strong><br/>
<strong>Correction:</strong> I went to the store <strong>because I was hungry.</strong> </li>

<li><strong>Fragment: Walking for hours.</strong><br/>
<strong>Correct:</strong> <strong>Walking for hours</strong> increases the heart rate and burns fat.</li></ul>

<em>Sentence fragments may be used occasionally in fiction to indicate an abrupt thought or to alter the pace. However, they are considered a grammatical error. You should avoid using sentence fragments. To check whether you are using a fragment, try reading your sentences aloud. Ask yourself whether each sentence makes sense on its own.</em>
