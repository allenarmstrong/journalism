	<h1>Run-on Sentences</h1>

<p>Run-on sentences are also grammatically incorrect.</p>

<p>A <strong>run-on sentence</strong> is a sentence that includes more than one idea without joining them together properly. It combines two or more <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Independent Clauses:</strong> A group or words including a subject and verb and completing a thought, another name for a sentence" data-position="top">independent clauses</span> without using appropriate connections.</p>

      <p><strong>Run-on: I went to the store I was hungry.</strong><br/>
<strong>Correct:</strong> I went to the store because I was hungry.</p>

<p><strong>Run-on: I'd been walking for hours I was exhausted.</strong><br/>
<strong>Correct:</strong> Since I'd been walking for hours, I was exhausted.</p>

<p>There are several ways to resolve run-on sentences:</p>

<ul><li>Break them into separate sentences.</li>
<li>Add in joining words (and, or, but, yet).</li>
<li>Use a semicolon.  </li></ul>

 <p> Take a look at this example and the resolutions: My good friend loves playing basketball, beach volleyball, and soccer he recently hurt himself and cannot play for months.</p>
