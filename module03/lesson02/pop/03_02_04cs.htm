	<h1>Comma Splices</h1>

<p>There are actually several ways to resolve run-on sentences. You may break them into separate sentences, add in joining words, or use appropriate punctuation.</p>

<p>One common problem that people run into when trying to fix run-on sentences is called a comma splice. This is when the writer joins two thoughts with just a comma. <strong>This is not a correct way to fix a sentence. </strong>Comma splices are also errors in sentence structure.</p>

<p>Take a look at the following examples of comma splices:</p>

<ul><li>I went to the store, I was hungry. </li>
<li>I'd been walking for hours, I was exhausted. </li>
<li>It's time to go to the movies, I can't wait.  </li>
<li>Let's talk to Marcia, she knows what's going on.  </li></ul>
<p>Test your understanding of comma splices.</p>
