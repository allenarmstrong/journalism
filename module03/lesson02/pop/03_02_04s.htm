	<h1>Semicolons</h1>
   <p> Let’s say you have a comma splice that you don’t want to turn into two different sentences. Instead, you would like to keep the “flow” of the thoughts together. There is a way to do this without breaking any rules!</p>

<p>The <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Semicolon:</strong> ; " data-position="top">semicolon</span> does what the comma cannot in these situations. Think of the semicolon as being a little bit stronger than the comma; it is able to join two related thoughts together in a sentence.</p>

<p>There are two important rules to follow when you are using semicolons:</p>

<ul><li>Both ideas must be <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Independent Clause:</strong> A group of words including a subject and verb and completing a thought, another name for a sentence." data-position="top">independent clauses</span>. You <strong>cannot</strong> put a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Dependent Clause:</strong> Includes a subject and a verb but does not express a complete thought." data-position="top">dependent clause</span> on one side of a semicolon.</li>
<li>Both ideas must be related. You cannot write, "I like bicycles; where’s my cheese?"</li></ul>
