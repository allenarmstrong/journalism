  <h1>Tell a Story&hellip;and Use Details</h1>
  <p>You’ve selected a topic, done some research, conducted interviews, and started writing your story. You’re almost there! Now it’s time to put everything together for a good, engaging read. </p>
  <p>The inverted pyramid isn’t usually your best bet for organizing your feature story. Instead, you’re writing something more like a narrative, which should read like a short story. You’ll want a beginning, middle, and end, and you’ll need to think about two important things: details and anecdotes.</p>
  <p>Let’s start with details.</p>
  <p>As you write the rest of your feature story, double-check to make sure you’re being descriptive. This means making sure your readers can visualize the important things you mention: people, places, and events. </p>
  <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Visualize:</strong> Imagine, picture in the mind" data-position="top"></span>
  <p>However, there are a few things you should keep in mind as you go:</p>

  <div id="clipboard">
    <div>
      <p><strong>Get to the point.</strong> Think of feature writing as telling a story. You can be a little more conversational than you would in a traditional news story, and your readers should feel like they’re sitting down to hear something from someone they trust. <br/><br/>
        Being descriptive doesn’t give you a free ticket to go on and on. Readers of feature stories expect simple, direct sentences that keep the story moving. Take a close look at your writing. Are there any words you could remove to make the description more clear? Get right to the heart of what you want your readers to visualize.
     
      <img src="images/03_04_02_clipping_ts.png" alt="  Day after day, for most of her 87 years, she took in bundles of dirty clothes and made them clean and neat for parties she never attended, weddings to which she was never invited, graduations she never saw." class="pull-left">
      <br/><br/>	
      Notice that the writer of this story got straight to the point. There was no need to describe the laundry in extra detail&#8212;the important part was the activity this person did and what she missed.</p>
      <p> <strong>Avoid stereotyping.</strong> You’re trying to help your audience see things and people as the really are. Make sure you avoid describing only the most stereotypical elements. Remember: there’s always more to a person than meets the eye. Your job as a feature writer is to dig deeper.
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Match your tone.</strong> Is your story about something serious? Then be serious as you describe your people, places, and events. Is your story about something humorous? Then you can be a little more lighthearted. <br/>
        To make sure your readers are in the right mood, match your tone to your subject. <br/>
        Consider these two scenarios:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PARENT 1:</strong> A mother says to her son, "I expect you home before midnight—not a minute after. When you get home, you had better wake me up so I can check the clock."<br/>
          Could you "hear" the parent's firm voice and see her facial expressions? From these words, we know she’s serious about the curfew, and we can conclude that if her son isn’t home on time, he’s going to be in trouble.</li>
        <li><strong>PARENT 2: </strong>Another father hugs his daughter as she heads out the door for her first date and says, "I'll see you around midnight, honey. I'll wait up so you can tell me all about your big night!"<br/>
          Could you "hear" this dad's kindness and feel the warmth of his words? From the brief description and the words spoken, we can conclude that this parent is more laid back than the first parent. If the teenager is a few minutes late getting home, it probably won’t be the end of the world. <br/>
        </li>
      </ul>
      In these two examples, we’re able to determine the tone by examining the words and descriptions. We can "hear" even though there’s no voice speaking to us.
      When you write, choose your words carefully so the appropriate tone comes across in your feature story.

    <p>Is your story missing some spice? <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Anecdotes:</strong> Short, interesting stories about people, places, or events" data-position="top">Anecdotes</span> will give it some flavor. </p>
    <p>Anecdotes are like tiny stories within your larger story. Sprinkle them throughout to keep your story interesting. </p>
    <p>For example, you could tell the story of a change in school legislation, or you could tell an anecdote about the student who is affected by that legislation. People are usually much more engaged when they read about the “human interest” element. </p>
    <p>To write a good anecdote, follow the three Es:</p>
    <div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
      <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseTwo">
          <h4 class="panel-title">Entertainment</h4>
        </div>
        <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse">
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Start off by entertaining your audience or getting their attention. Think of this as the opening to a tiny short story that goes within your feature. Begin with an entertaining description or quote that will keep your readers going. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!--End item #1-->
      
      <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseThree">
          <h4 class="panel-title">Explanation</h4>
        </div>
        <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse">
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Next, explain what this anecdote is about. What should your reader learn from this part of your story? Think of this as your conclusion. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!--End item #2-->
      
      <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseFour">
          <h4 class="panel-title">Emotion</h4>
        </div>
        <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse">
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Make sure your readers feel an emotional pull from your anecdote. This may be something dramatic, or it may make them smile. Any emotion is fine as long as it matches the tone of your story.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!--End item #3--> 
    </div>
    <!--End Accordion-->
    
    <p>Your anecdote may be as short as one or two sentences, but with these three Es, it will stick in your readers’ minds and keep them going! </p>
    <div class="well infobox">
      <div class="icon_local" data-icon="icon_infobox"></div>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>VERY IMPORTANT:</h2>
        <p>You may <strong>not</strong> make up anecdotes. Your readers are counting on you to tell them the truth. Even though you’re writing a descriptive story, you must be truthful at all times. </p>
        <p>But if you can’t make them up, then how do you get anecdotes? </p>
        <p>You can often find good anecdotes by asking the right questions in your interviews. It may be useful to do some follow-up conversations with your interviewees at this point. Ask questions like "Can you tell me about a time this happened to you?"</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Finally, remember that you’re still a journalist, and you should remain impartial in most of your feature writing. This can be tough when you’re telling stories that are packed with details and emotions. Remind yourself all the time that it is your job to present the truth as it is so your readers can make up their minds on their own! </p>
