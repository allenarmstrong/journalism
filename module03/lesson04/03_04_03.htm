	<h1>Conclusions</h1>
    <p>Once you’ve told your story, it’s time to reach your conclusion. </p>
<p>Some of the most satisfying feature stories reflect on their openings when they get to the conclusion. Think of this as “coming full circle.” You’ve reached the end, and it’s time to look back at where you started.</p>
<p>Many writers take this opportunity to revise their opening. You may want to do the same. Take a look at your lead. Does it match the tone of your story, now that you’ve finished writing it? Does it grab your readers’ attention? Does it set you up to write a good conclusion? </p>

    <div class="col-lg-5"><br><br><p>Notice how the writer of this feature came full circle at the end of his story. He found a quote about the laundry, and used it in his conclusion. It's possible he went back to revise his lead once he got this good quote. What can you do to make your lead and conclusion connect with each other? </p></div>
