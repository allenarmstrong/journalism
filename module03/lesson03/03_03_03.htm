<h1>Using Media</h1>

<p>Now that you’ve considered the ethical <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Implications:</strong> Effects or possible results" data-position="top">implications</span> of your work, it’s time to get started putting something together. </p>
<p>Early American journalism used technology that would seem primitive today. It took hours to put one page together, and there were no pictures, radio clips, video, or clickable links online. </p>
<p>Today’s journalists have many more efficient tools at their disposal, but they’re always trying to learn more so they can stay ahead of the game. Keep up with trends in technology to be a leader in your industry! </p>

<p><strong>Standard Tools:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Computer</li>
<li>Word processing programs </li>
<li>Camera</li></ul>

           <ul><li>If you’re adding music, you must have permission to use that music, and your audience must understand that you added it for effect. Don’t let your audience think the music was playing in the background of your interview if it wasn’t!</li>
<li>If you’re going to record your own voice, do a warm-up first and practice saying any difficult names or places. </li>
<li>Check the audio levels of your voice or the voice of the people you’re interviewing. Most audio software will give you a visual indication to help you. If your sounds go “red,” they’re probably too loud. See if you can adjust them or re-record if necessary.</li>
<li>Check your recording sound ahead of time&#8212;do a test to see if there is the sound of a fan or anything that will make it difficult to hear what you are saying. </li>
<li>Unless quiet pauses are important to your story, edit out any blank spaces of sound.</li></ul>

<li>When putting two images on the same screen, try to make their subjects both face inward rather than out. </li>
<li>Make sure the text and images on your screen or page are easy to read. Don’t squish a lot of things together in one space!</li>
<li>Many newspapers and magazines try to have at least one eye-catching image per page. </li>
<li>Use photo editing software to make sure your images are the perfect size. </li></ul>
