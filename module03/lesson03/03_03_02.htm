<h1>Touching Up Ethics</h1>
<p>In 2003, photojournalist Brian Walski combined two images for the Los Angeles Times to make a more exciting picture. The change left readers believing a soldier had pointed his weapon at a man carrying a child, when the reality had been a bit different. </p>
<img src="images/03_03_02_animated.gif" alt="In the first original picture, a soldier holds his gun up and raises the palm of his free hand at a group of people. Another man with a child in his arms stands at a distance, looking away. 

In the second original picture, the soldier has both his gun and free arm lowered as the man with a child approaches.

The combined picture shows the soldier holding his gun up and raising his palm as the man with the child approaches. The effect suggests the soldier was threatening the man with the child, when, in fact, he was not.

<p>The picture ran in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and other news organizations picked it up before people noticed the problem: it didn’t depict what actually happened. Walski had not been honest with his audience. </p>
<p>That dishonesty got Walski fired. </p>
<p>When people read, watch, or listen to the news, they’re looking for the truth. Altering a photograph for dramatic effect may make the picture more exciting, but it doesn’t make it true. Many news organizations and news consumers will get upset about that. </p>
<p>For your own feature news story, you will include images and/or sounds that will help tell your story. However, you must pay close attention to your own ethical behavior as you take pictures, record sounds, and prepare media to go with your writing. </p>
<p>Be honest! </p>
<p>Before you begin, let’s review codes of ethics. Visual and audio journalists must follow ethical guidelines just like everybody else. Here are a few examples of standards from the the National Press Photographers Association to keep in mind as you write. </p>
