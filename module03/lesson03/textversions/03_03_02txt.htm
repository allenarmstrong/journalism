<p> Technology has totally changed the face of journalism. What used to take days to get from print to public now only takes seconds.</p>
<p>As a result, making ethical decisions has become more and more difficult.</p><p> While adding images and other visuals to your story definitely makes it more interesting,
  there are ethical guidelines you must follow. Here are a few to consider as you write your feature story:</p>
<p>Resist manipulating your audience by staging photo ops. This makes your subject appear inauthentic.</p>
<p>Provide context and avoid stereotypes.</p>
<p>You want to give your readers the full story, but not the one that pushes irrelevant or harmful stereotypes.</p>
<p>Avoid presenting images with personal bias.</p>
<p>Manipulating readers based on personal preference is bad journalism. Provide readers with the facts and let them decide for themselves.</p>
<p>While photographing, never intentionally contribute, alter, or influence events. </p>
<p>This can confuse the truth and lead to misinformation.</p>
<p>Do not manipulate images or sounds in any way that can mislead viewers or
  misrepresent subjects. As a journalist, you’ll lose credibility, and your work will be tainted.</p>
<p>Do not pay sources or subjects for information or participation. People may say what you want or do what you ask for the right price. This isn’t necessarily the truth, and it isn’t ethical journalism.</p>
<p>By keeping these and other ethical guidelines in mind, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a journalist.</p>
