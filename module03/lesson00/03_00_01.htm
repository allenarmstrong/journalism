    <h1>Ethics in Journalism</h1>
      
        
      <p>Sometimes it’s difficult to do the right thing—or even to know what the right thing is. For example, is it good or bad to be honest with a friend? Is there ever a situation where you might owe it to your friend to hide the truth, or do you owe it to your friend to always be honest? How will you know the answer? </p>
<p>When you find yourself in a situation where there is an argument for both sides, you may feel frustrated and confused. This kind of thing happens to people many times, and it is known as a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Dilemma:</strong> A difficult problem in which the answer is not immediately clear" data-position="top">dilemma</span>. Journalists also encounter dilemmas in their work.</p>
<p>Being a respected journalist requires responsibility. Because a reporter provides news to the public, people may take what is written or said very seriously. Therefore, every reporter has an <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Ethical:</strong> Moral" data-position="top">ethical</span> duty to present accurate information. Otherwise, audiences may become confused, and they may take actions that are inappropriate because the information in the news was incorrect. In this way, journalists have important and difficult jobs!</p>
<p>As you go through this module, you’ll learn about the Code of Ethics. Ask yourself what you would do if you were a journalist facing a dilemma. Sometimes the answer isn’t easy! </p>
