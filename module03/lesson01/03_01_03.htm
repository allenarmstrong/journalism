<p>This story about the gang shooting really happened. Before going to print, the newspaper contacted the boy’s family to ask for their feelings. The family decided it was important to run the image and the details of the story so they could bring awareness to a violent problem in their community.  </p>
<p>There are many important questions a news organization must consider in this delicate situation. Here are a few:</p>
<ul><li>Is there a strong reason to share this with the public? In other words, is it newsworthy?</li>
<li>If innocent people may be harmed by this story or image, has their position been considered carefully? </li>
<li>If you are publishing shocking images, have they been tastefully presented? Keep in mind that many people react negatively to seeing photographs of blood that are in color (as opposed to black and white).  </li>
<li>Is there any way to prepare your audience for what might be a disturbing image? </li>
<li>If your audience reacts negatively to the story or the image, how will you defend your decision? </li></ul>

When Manning Pynn had been the business editor of the <em>Miami Herald </em>for less than a week, he received a leather valise with his initials embossed on it in gold. It was a gift from a local business leader who wanted to welcome him to the position at the newspaper. Pynn returned the present. <blockquote>"We pretty much broadcast that we're not open for business like that," Pynn said. "We're not going to be bought. But you constantly have people who want to try. They're just trying to find out what your price is." 
"Basically," Pynn said, "when we write the news, it's because it's newsworthy, and we don't care what you've got or what kinds of strings you've pulled or if you buy ads with the paper or you don't."</blockquote></div>
