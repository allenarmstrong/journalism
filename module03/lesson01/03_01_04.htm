      <h1>Feature News Writing</h1>
      <p>Now that you understand the basics of ethical codes in journalism, it’s time to focus on your own writing again. This time you will work on a feature story&#8212;also known as a human interest story. </p>
<p>How are features different from more traditional news stories?</p>
<ul><li>Instead of “breaking” news, feature stories provide an in-depth look at a story over time.</li>
<li>Instead of using the inverted pyramid, feature stories tell about the people and events&#8212;more like a narrative. </li>
<li>Feature stories give colorful details that allow the reader to really imagine what happened. </li>
<li>Feature stories are often longer than traditional news stories. They can even span several articles over a long period of time. </li></ul>
<p>Do features and traditional news stories have anything in common?</p>
<ul><li>They both answer the 5Ws and one H. <img src="../../module02/lesson02/images/02_02_02_infographic_ts.png" alt="Start by asking the 5Ws and one H: Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How. " data-text="textversion/03_01_04txt.htm" class="normal">
</li>
<li>They both inform the public about a useful or interesting topic. </li>
<li>They both require the journalist to do research and interview people. </li>
<li>They can both present journalists with ethical dilemmas. </li></ul>
<p>Take a look at the opening for this feature story and compare it with the lead in this traditional news story. They are about similar topics, but can you see how they have been handled differently? </p>

    By: Rick Bragg </strong></p>
    <p>Oseola McCarty spent a lifetime making other people look nice. Day after day, for most of her 87 years, she took in bundles of dirty clothes and made them clean and neat for parties she never attended, weddings to which she was never invited, graduations she never saw.</p>
<p>She had quit school in the sixth grade to go to work, never married, never had children and never learned to drive because there was never any place in particular she wanted to go. All she ever had was the work, which she saw as a blessing. Too many other black people in rural Mississippi did not have even that.</p>
<p>She spent almost nothing, living in her old family home, cutting the toes out of shoes if they did not fit right and binding her ragged Bible with Scotch tape to keep Corinthians from falling out. Over the decades, her pay -- mostly dollar bills and change -- grew to more than $150,000.</p>
<p>"More than I could ever use," Miss McCarty said the other day without a trace of self-pity. So she is giving her money away, to finance scholarships for black students at the University of Southern Mississippi here in her hometown, where tuition is $2,400 a year.</p></div>

<p>BOSTON (AP) — A small private liberal arts college in western Massachusetts has announced the establishment of a scholarship fund dedicated to helping illegal immigrants get degrees.</p>
<p>The scholarship will provide more than $25,000 each year to help an illegal immigrant pay for the $43,000-plus tuition at Hampshire College in Amherst. At current funding levels, the endowment will help support one student's studies at the college every four years, said college spokeswoman Elaine Thomas.</p></div>
