Male interviewee #1:</strong> What do I think journalism is?</p>

<p><strong>Female interviewee #1:</strong> Journalism is reporting news and current events either through photography, print, radio, television, or other forms of media.</p>

<p><strong>Male interviewee #1:</strong> Is it about taking a long “journey-lism”?</p>

<p><strong>Female interviewee #2:</strong> It’s how you look at people; how you judge them.</p>

<p><strong>Male interviewee #2:</strong> Journalism today is a business.</p>

<p><strong>Female interviewee #2:</strong> That’s journalism.</p>

<p><strong>Female interviewee #3:</strong> …And it can be in the form of newspapers, the Internet…</p>

<p><strong>Male interviewee #3:</strong> Journalism is the recording of history, hopefully objective, without opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Female interviewee #2:</strong> Journalism can be true, to the eye, and it can be false; it’s how you look at it.</p>

<p><strong>Female interviewee #3:</strong> I think journalism is the study of how news media collects information.</p>

<p><strong>Female interviewee #4:</strong> Journalism to me is a recording.</p>

<p><strong>Male interviewee #2:</strong> You’re journaling events. You’re cataloging events in time: people, places, things.</p>

<p><strong>Female interviewee #4:</strong> When I do my own journal, I’m recording my own life, and I expect others to learn and grow and be provoked.</p>

<p><strong>Female interviewee #5:</strong> I think that journalism is your opportunity to share the truth.</p>
