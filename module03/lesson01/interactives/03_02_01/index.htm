    <div class="under"><h3>"Do not accept gifts, favors, or compensation from those who might seek to influence coverage"</h3>
    
    
    <p>Accepting gifts may influence you to report things inaccurately.  Even if you know that you can be trusted, others may lose their faith in your credibility and think you will report positive things about anyone who pays you.</p></div>
    <div class="over"><p>He gave me great tickets; I wonder if I can make him look extra nice in this photo...</p> </div>

  <div class="under"><h3>"While photographing subjects do not intentionally contribute to, alter, or seek to alter or influence events."</h3>
    
    
    <p>A journalist is an observer, not someone who stages events.  What you show the public should be the truth as it happened without your involvement.</p></div>
    <div class="over"><p>Now, if I just make this room look a little messier...</p> </div>

    <div class="under"><h3>"Be complete and provide context when photographing or recording subjects.  Avoid stereotyping individuals and groups.  Recognize and work to avoid presenting one's own biases in the work."</h3>
    
    
    <p>Anybody can put something on the ground and take a picture of it. However, that does not represent how things are in ordinary circumstances. Try to find candid shots of real life.</p></div>
    <div class="over"><p>Miss, would you mind holding this feather duster...</p> </div>

   <div class="under"><h3>"Do not intentionally sabotage the efforts of other journalists."</h3>
    
    
    <p>Though you may want to be recognized for your skills and hard work, you must allow other journalists to get the story as well.  You do not own the news, and it is in the best interest of the public to let all journalists gather any information they need.</p></div>
    <div class="over"><p>If I park my car here, nobody else will be able to take a shot of the crime scene...</p> </div>

    <h3>"Treat all subjects with respect and dignity.  Give special consideration to vulnerable subjects and compassion to victims of crime and tragedy.  Intrude on private moments of grief only the public has an overriding and justifiable need to see."</h3>
    
    
    <p>Never victimize the victim.  Ask yourself who benefits from the picture being published.  If it is simply going to draw unwanted attention to the victim, then it may not be necessary.  However, if it will draw attention to an important problem in society, then perhaps the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.</p></div>

    <h3>"Resist being manipulated by staged photo opportunities."</h3>
    
    
    <p>If you are a member of one political party, do not go out of your way to find members of the opposite party looking bad for the camera. As a journalist, you must strive to be fair.</p></div>

  <div class="under"><h3>"Be accurate and comprehensive in the representation of subjects."</h3>
    
    
    <p>The first mission of journalism is to report the truth.  Try to capture things as they truly are so that the audience can know what really happened.</p></div>
    <div class="over"><p>I need to be sensitive about how I take this shot...</p> </div>

   <div class="under"><h3>"Do not pay sources or subjects or reward them materially for information or participation."</h3>
    
    
    <p>Paying people alters reality because people will do things for money that they will not do without it.  As a journalist, you must never distort reality.</p></div>
    <div class="over"><p>Hey, I'll give you ten bucks to lie on the ground and look hurt...</p> </div>

    <p>Though you have the ability to alter photographs for emotional effect, you should not.  Your audience trusts you to present things exactly as they are.</p></div>
