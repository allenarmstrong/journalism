      <h1>Ethical Dilemmas</h1>
      
<p>Your newspaper has sent you to a nearby school to do a story. While you’re there, a gang shooting breaks out and a 15-year-old boy is killed. There’s enough time for you to get some basic information and take a photograph of the boy lying on the ground before authorities arrive.</p> 
<p>As a journalist, you know this is important news. However, you also know there are many things to consider before publishing the story&#8212;and the picture. </p>
<p>Questions about ethics can be difficult to answer. What’s the right decision when both sides have strong arguments? </p>
<p>To handle ethical dilemmas, many news organizations have created their own codes of ethics. These codes are specific to the organization; there isn’t a set list of rules that all journalists must follow. </p>
<h1>Codes of Ethics </h1>
<p>Writers and photographers alike must follow codes in order to work professionally and ethically. The National Press Photographers Association brings together professional, retired, and student visual journalists from around the world, providing them with mentors, feedback, ethical guidance, and more. They offer their own <a href="https://nppa.org/code_of_ethics" class="external-link" data-width="80%" data-height="80%">nine-part code of ethics</a>. Some of these include:</p>
<ul><li>providing context and avoiding bias with photographs</li>
<li>maintaining the integrity of the photograph when editing</li>
<li>resisting manipulation by staged photo opportunities</li></ul>
<p><a href="//spj.org/ethicscode.asp" class="external-link" data-width="80%" data-height="80%">The Society of Professional Journalists</a> adopted four more basic principles (most of them from <a href="//www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=36&amp;aid=4349" class="external-link" data-width="80%" data-height="80%">Bob Steele</a> at the Poynter Institute) that most ethical journalists are expected to follow. The Society of Professional Journalists is an organization that connects and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Advocates:</strong> Speaks or writes in defense" data-position="top">advocates</span> for journalists in the United States and around the world. The Poynter Institute is a Florida-based school for journalism that provides seminars and other classes to professional journalists, students of journalism, and instructors.</p>
<p>Though there are many difficult choices to make in journalism, the very best choice you can make is to act ethically!</p>
<p>Take a look at the following examples of ethical questions a journalist might encounter on the job.</p>
