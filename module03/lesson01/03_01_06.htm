  <p>For this <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>, you must choose a topic for a feature story that you will write over the next few lessons. Your topic options are listed here. Please pick the <strong>one</strong> that interests you the most:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gender Bias in the Media</strong> – For example, do males or females get an unfair advantage in jobs in the media? Look at leadership positions, appearance requirements, equal pay, etc. There are many other ways to explore this topic, as well! </li>
    <li><strong>Controversies in Sports</strong> – For example, when do rule book interpretations interfere with the outcome of a game? Look at debated wins and losses, etc. There are many other ways to explore this topic, as well!</li>
    <li><strong>Generational Differences</strong> – For example, is there a generational divide when it comes to the adoption of new technology? Look at games, social media, workplace technology, etc. There are many other ways to explore this topic, as well! </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember, you will be writing a feature story using one of these topics. This means you will have to find a human-interest subject within your topic that you can report as a narrative. </p>
