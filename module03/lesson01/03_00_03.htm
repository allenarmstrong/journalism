<p>This pretest challenges you to stretch your mind muscles. It helps you grow as a learner and helps your teacher guide you through the learning process. So take time to really show what you know. You are not expected to know all the information, and this pretest will not negatively impact your grade in this course. It will, however, help you learn.
