<p><em>But what about ethics?</em> Did Rick Bragg face any ethical concerns when he was writing this feature story? </p>
<p>For example, imagine he discovered personal details about Osceola McCarty and the Bullock family that they didn’t want to see printed in the newspaper. What should he have done in that situation?  </p>
<p>Often, especially in feature writing, reporters will uncover strange or interesting facts. Some of these facts might be damaging to the people they’re writing about. A journalist must work with his or her organization to decide what belongs in the story and what doesn’t.  </p>
<p>Remember, the Society of Professional Journalists recommends that you <strong>Seek Truth and Report It, Minimize Harm, Act Independently,</strong> and <strong>Be Accountable and Transparent. </strong> </p>
<p>Poynter also lists <a href="//l.flvsgl.com/GSL0c2d8db758f078b76a3740183cf50562c/" class="external-link" data-width="80%" data-height="80%">10 useful questions</a> you can ask yourself in order to make good ethical decisions. One of the most important to keep in mind is this: </p>
<p><strong>Can I clearly and fully justify my thinking and my decision?</strong></p>
<p>When you consider these important reminders before you write your story, you are much more likely to act ethically.</p>
