	<h1>Assessment</h1>
    <p>For this assessment, you must answer the following question in one paragraph of at least five sentences:</p>
    <p><strong>How can technology make news more engaging and understandable? </strong></p>
   <br />
    <p>Different news outlets use different methods to keep your interest. A radio news segment about a parade might include music or sounds of people cheering. A newspaper might choose an active picture of an athlete for a story about a football game. CNN once even used holographic images to make their field reporters appear to be standing in the newsroom with the anchors!  </p>
    <p>Find an example of one recent news story that you think has used technology successfully and link it in your submission. This example can include graphic art, photography, interactive elements, audio, or another form of technology that has improved your ability to appreciate and understand the news. </p>
