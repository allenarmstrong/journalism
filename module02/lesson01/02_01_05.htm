    <p>As you search for details about your chosen career, you may find conflicting information.This is a problem journalists deal with every day. Researching the validity of something can be a tricky process.<br>Take a look at this <a href="//cdn.flvs.net/cdn/lo/research_asset_gold/" class="external-link">research tutorial</a> for a similar situation. </p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p class="gs">Most Internet searches begin with a search engine such as Google or Bing. <br>
        <br>
        Once you’re there, type in your search. For
        example, you might type "Reporting careers in television journalism." Be as specific as possible to narrow down the results. For example, typing in "Journalism careers" is going to give you very different results than "Reporting careers in television journalism."</p>
