      <p>
Conduct some research into the different positions that are available in journalism. Keep in mind that some skill sets remain the same for long periods of time, but others change as consumers of news change.

    <div class="panel-body">
  
      <p>Think about your interests and your natural abilities. Which news medium is the most interesting to you? Does radio seem like the most exciting position, or would you rather work at a newspaper or television station? Are you interested in something that is strictly online?

Be sure to get as much information as possible so you’re prepared when you apply.

Compare that pay with other jobs. What do you think?</p>

      <p>If you know you’re an excellent writer, you may want to consider reporting. If your talents are more visual, you may want to consider photography or page layout. Take a close look at what you know you can do well, and ask yourself what skills you want to develop. This may help you decide what you’d be happiest doing for a living.</p>
