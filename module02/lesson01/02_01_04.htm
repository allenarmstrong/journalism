  <p>In your search for job openings in journalism, you’ll probably find that many positions require some level of higher education and/or experience. Many companies today want new journalists to hold bachelor's degrees in journalism or communications. Some journalists even get graduate degrees to increase their hireability. Internships and other newsroom experience can also be quite helpful to add to your résumé. </p>

  <p>Although interest inventories are helpful in sorting through your preferences, only you can tell what you would most like to do. Also, because every news organization is unique, every position in journalism is a little different. Some places may require a lot of work from certain employees, while other places will require less from the same position. The best way to learn what’s right for you is to research potential careers carefully. Put together a list of things that interest you and compare them with job listings. Soon you’ll have a collection of information about your own interests that can point you in the right direction for your future. </p>
