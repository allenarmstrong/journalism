<p>There are many ways to explore positions in journalism when you are a high school or college student. One useful place to begin is by looking at the organization where you would most like to work. Whether it’s a highly selective major network or newspaper, don’t sweat it—you can get ahead of the game by learning early on what the hiring requirements are. </p>
<p>Look for current employment opportunites online. Seeing the job descripitions and requirements now will give you a better understanding of what companies want in a prospective hire.</p> 
<p>If you can’t find any job openings you like online, call a department that interests you. Ask for details about their hiring process and any current openings. You can tell them you’re a journalism student who’s planning ahead. Who knows? You could be talking to your future editor.  </p>
<p>Another way to learn about careers in journalism is to contact a journalist you admire. Introduce yourself as a journalism student who is looking for information about careers in the industry. Ask the journalist what the path to his or her current position was like, and what advice might be good for you to follow. This is a great way to gain a networking contact and to learn specific details about the career path of a real journalist!</p>
<h2>Internships</h2>
<p>Internships are a big part of most journalists’ early careers. These positions can be paid or unpaid, depending on the hiring organization. An intern’s duties may vary, but expect to work with others in your field as you gain valuable experience. When your internship ends, the organization may hire you full time, or you can use your new skills to apply for jobs at other organizations that interest you.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>As you plan for your career, think carefully about the future of journalism. Many studies show that the Internet has marked another shift in the face of journalism. The different media outlets that people use to get their news have changed and continue to change every day. To make an informed decision about the best possible career for you, it is important to pay attention to current trends and possibilities for the future. </p>
