	<h1>Standard Newswriting Style</h1>
    
    <img src="images/02_03_02_writing_ts.png" alt="">
    <p>Once you begin writing your first draft, you will need to take the standard newswriting style into consideration. This means your writing should follow the common guidelines for journalism.</p>
<p>To begin, you must be comfortable with basic grammar rules. If you know you have difficulty with grammar, you should consult a grammar book or visit a grammar website for help. One good website is the <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/1/5/" class="external-link">Purdue Online Writing Lab</a>.</p>
<p>For a refresher, let's look at some common grammatical errors people tend to make.</p>
<h1>Subject/Verb Agreement</h1>
<p>Subjects and verbs must agree in sentences. But what does this really mean? When we say that these two things must “agree,” we mean that they must agree in number. In other words, if the subject is singular, then the verb must also be singular. If the subject is plural, then the verb must also be plural.</p>


<div class="tabs">
    <a class="tab" title="header_title" >Subjects</a>
    <div class="panel">
        <h3><strong>Subjects</strong> are the main idea of the sentence.</h3>
           <p>In the sentence <em>“Joe threw the ball to Maria,” </em>Joe is the main idea because he is the one performing the action. He’s the one throwing the ball. <em>“Joe”</em> is the subject.</p>
    </div><!--End tab #1-->
    
    <a class="tab" title="header_title">Verbs</a>
    <div class="panel">
          <h3><strong>Verbs</strong> are the action of the sentence.</h3>
           <p> <p>In the sentence<em> “Joe threw the ball to Maria,”</em> the verb is <em>“threw.”</em> </p>
      <p>Some verbs refer to a subject's state of being. </p>
<ul>
  <li>In the sentence <em>“Sam was friends with Jackie,”</em> Sam is in the state of being friends. The verb is the word <em>“was.”</em></li>
<li>The verb to be (I am, you are, he/she/it is, we are, they are) (I was, you were, he/she/it was, we were, they were) (I will be, you will be, he/she/it will be, we will be, they will be) refers to a state of being rather than an action. It still follows the subject/verb agreement rule.</li></ul>

<p>Subject/verb agreement can get a bit tricky when the subjects and verbs appear far apart from each other in sentences. </p>
