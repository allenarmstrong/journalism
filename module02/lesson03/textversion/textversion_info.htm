	<h2>Grammar for Journalists</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Check for Subject/Verb Agreement</strong><br>
   <em>Identify your subject as a singular or plural and use the corresponding verb.</em><br>
      Singular: The officer wants to question the subject.<br>
      Plural: The offers want to question he suspect.</li> </ol>
    
    <ol start="2">
      <li><strong>Be Sure to Use Correct Pronouns</strong><br>
        <em>Subject pronouns do the action.</em><br>
      I, we, you, he, she, it, they<br>
      <em>Object pronouns receive the action.</em><br>
      Me, us, you, him, her, it, them</li></ol>
   
    <ol start="3">
      <li><strong>Use Active Structure</strong><br>
        <em>Active structure makes writing clear and concise.</em><br>
      Active: Smith hit a home run, winning the game.<br>
      Passive: The game was won after a home run was hit by Smith.</li> </ol>
    
    <ol start="4">
      <li><strong>Check For Parallel Structure</strong><br>
   
        <em>Parallel structure gives equal meaning to words and clauses that appear in lists.</em><br>
      Incorrect: The journalist used the dictionary in order to check spelling, find meaning, and looking up pronunciations.<br>
      Correct: The journalist used the dictionary to check the spelling, find meaning, and look up pronunciations.</li> </ol>
    <ol start="5">
      <li><strong>Know How to Use a Colon</strong><br>
    
        <em>Use when introducing a list or quotation.</em><br>
      The following items were on the table: a rope, a candlestick, a revolver, and a lead pipe.<br>
      Ms. Peacock&rsquo;s remarks on her whereabouts were brief: &ldquo;I was in the library.&rdquo;<br><br>
      <em>Use between two simple sentences to emphasize the second. </em><br>
      I don&rsquo;t know why everyone likes that movie: the plot is so predictable.</li></ol>
    <ol start="6">
      <li><strong>Know How to Use a Semicolon</strong><br>
        <em>Use when linking simple sentences that are related.</em><br>
      Jack likes tea; Jill prefers coffee.<br><br>
      <em>Use when items in a series already have commas.</em><br>
      This summer I traveled to Anaheim, California; Denver, Colorado; and Nashville, Tennessee.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="7">
      <li><strong>Vary Your Phrasing for Interest</strong><br>
        <em>Repetitive writing can bore readers. Use words and phrases that make writing come to life.</em><br>
      Boring: On Friday the high school band performed. They marched onto the football field. They played the fight song. The crowd cheered. They wore blue and gold uniforms.<br>
      Interesting: On Friday, a team of students in blue and gold uniforms marched onto the school field to the sounds of a cheering crowd. They weren&rsquo;t there to play football. They were there to lead the pep rally.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="8">
      <li><strong>Always Check for Correct Spelling</strong><br>
        <em>Spell check is not enough! Be sure to check for these commonly confused words:</em>
   <ul><li> accept/except</li>
     <li> desert/dessert</li>
      <li>it&rsquo;s/its</li>
<li>      loose/lose</li>
<li>      principal/principle</li>
    <li>  their/there/they&rsquo;re</li>
     <li> to/too/two</li></ul></li>
