	<h1>Active Sentence Structure</h1>
    <p>News happens quickly, and much of it has a major impact on the lives of real people. That is why newswriting should be as crisp and clear as possible. Active sentence structure can help with this.</p>

        <p><strong>Note: </strong>As with many elements of the English language, the term active sentence structure refers to several different things, and writers can achieve active structure in several different ways. For the purpose of this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, we will focus on active subjects and verbs in newswriting.</p>

<p>Take a look at this lead:</p>
<p><strong>Seven stores were robbed late last night by a single, unidentified person who was seen wearing a black mask on the face area.</strong></p>
<p>Twenty-three words; not bad! This lead could use a few more specific details, such as the general location of the stores, but it expresses important information in a short amount of space. And yet, there is definitely room for improvement in the writing.</p>
<p>Because news should feel immediate and active, writers should avoid passive sentence structure. </p>

        <h3 class="panel-title">What’s passive sentence structure?</h3>

      <p>Passive sentence structure generally refers to structures where the subject of the sentence is not performing the action. This means that the main focus of the sentence isn’t really doing anything at all. It just sits there while things happen to it. </p><p>Example: <br/>
        <em>The <a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="The subject in the lead sentence above." data-trigger="hover">seven stores</a> are the focus, and they didn’t do anything. They just sat there and got robbed.</em></p>

<p>Take a closer look at this part of the lead:</p>
<img src="images/02_03_04_shops_ts.png" alt="">
<p>Seven stores were robbed late last night by a single, unidentified person. </p>
<p>“Seven stores” is the main idea, or <strong>subject</strong>, and they’re just sitting there, being burglarized. That kind of sentence structure can be long, boring, and even confusing. It’s known as <strong>passive construction</strong>. The solution to this kind of problem is normally in the verb. In the example above, “were” is the verb. Not very exciting. Try changing the subject altogether and switching the verb to see if that helps.</p>
<p>While you’re at it, remove anything that isn’t necessary information for the lead.</p>

<img src="images/02_03_04_robber_ts.png" alt="">
<p>An unidentified person robbed seven stores last night. </p>
<p>Much more immediate! Do you see how this structure brings the audience closer to the action of the sentence? The meaning is the same, but the words are more exciting. We call this <strong>active construction</strong>.</p>
<p>What else in this lead could be more active? </p>
<p><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="You have already found that this part of the lead could be more active by changing the subject to the person rather than the store. “An unidentified person robbed seven stores last night.”"  data-trigger="hover">Seven stores were robbed late last night by a single, unidentified person</a> <a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="In this part of the sentence, the suspect isn’t doing anything, and someone else is looking at what the robber is wearing. That’s passive construction. Also notice that a mask usually goes on the face area, so these words could be removed to make the sentence less clunky."  data-trigger="hover">who was seen wearing a black mask on the face area.</a></p><p>Consider this revision: An unidentified person in a black mask robbed seven stores last night.</p>
