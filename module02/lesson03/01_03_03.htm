	<h1>Fortunes in Journalism </h1>
    <p>In the late 1800s and early 1900s, people had developed such an interest in news that it became possible to make a huge fortune as a publisher or editor in the journalism industry. One notable person to do this was William Randolph Hearst. </p>

    <p>William Randolph Hearst made his fortune through <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Sensationalizing:</strong> Making exciting without regard for the truth" data-position="top">sensationalizing</span> journalism. He took over several publications and showed more of an interest in sales than in credibility. Many of his newspapers <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Exploited:</strong> Used for profit" data-position="top">exploited</span> stories to make them seem more sensational than they were in reality. This practice led to what became known as <br /><span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Yellow Journalism:</strong> Irresponsible reporting in an attempt to get more readers" data-position="top">yellow journalism</span>. </p>
    
    <p>In 1941, actor and director Orson Welles released a fictional exposé of the publishing industry, Citizen Kane. The film depicted a publisher much like William Randolph Hearst. </p>

    <p>By the 1950s, many homes in the United States had at least one television, and the demand for regular news updates grew. In the 1980s, media tycoon Ted Turner invested in Cable News Network, or CNN. This became the first channel to provide 24-hour news coverage. </p>
    <p>Billionaire Rupert Murdoch became a household name as he built his media empire through the acquisition of several companies. As CEO of News Corporation, Murdoch owns Fox News, the New York Post newspaper, HarperCollins Publishers, the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios, MySpace, and many other media sources.</p>

    <h2>Journalism’s Gatekeepers</h2>
    
    <p>In such a thriving industry, it is not uncommon for journalists themselves to become famous. The people and companies that have dedicated their careers to bringing important information to the public are known as journalism’s “gatekeepers.” In other words, these are trained and educated professionals who work for organizations that hold them accountable for bringing quality news to the public.</p>
    
    <div class="alert alert-warning">Insert image: Any image of Matthew Brady’s wartime photos</div>

	<p>Matthew Brady was one of the most famous photojournalists during the Civil War. His visual depictions of death and destruction added to the news stories people read, and public interest in news about the war grew.</p>
    <p>Edward R. Murrow gained public attention first as a radio broadcast journalist and then later, on television news. His famous sign-off line, “Good night, and good luck,” is also the title of a recent film about his influential career. Murrow’s sense of ethics, clear speaking voice, and strong reporting skills earned him the respect of audiences and journalists. Among his most memorable broadcasts were his on-air observations of the battles of World War II and his effective television criticisms of Senator Joseph McCarthy during the communism scare of the 1950s.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-warning">Insert image: Any image of Woodward and Bernstein?</div>
    
    <p>President Richard Nixon’s political career came to an end in part due to strong investigative journalism by <em>The Washington Post</em>. Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein spent long hours researching what became known as the Watergate scandal. As a result of this investigative reporting, Woodward and Bernstein became famous and Nixon resigned his position as president. The film <em>All the President’s Men</em> re-creates these events.</p>
    
    <div class="alert alert-warning">Insert image: Any image of Anderson Cooper?</div>

	<p>Anderson Cooper made a name for himself as a celebrity journalist after he served in several positions as a television news reporter and anchor. During his coverage of Hurricane Katrina, he set himself apart from many other reporters when he expressed emotion and anger on screen about the people suffering in New Orleans. </p>
    
    <p>In the 1990s, CNN itself gained prestige as it ran regular stories about the Gulf War. Officials at the Pentagon referred to the “CNN effect,” describing how significantly the public’s constant access to news affected government policies and decisions. </p>

	<h2>Who Are the Gatekeepers Now?</h2>
    
    <p>With the rapid advancement of technology, more and more people are able to participate in the spreading of news. Suddenly it’s not only the trained and educated journalists who provide information; now anyone with an online connection can let the world know what is happening in his or her area in just moments. </p>
    <p>In many ways, this is an exciting time because it means news can spread faster and more easily than ever before. However, it is also a time of <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Rampant:</strong> Spreading quickly without anyone checking it" data-position="top">rampant</span> misinformation because we often don’t know which sources we can trust. In a world where anyone can post news online, who will make sure the “facts” are true? </p>
