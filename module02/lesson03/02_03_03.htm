	<h1>Pronouns </h1>
    <p>Pronouns must match their appropriate place in the sentence. What does this mean? Some pronouns will always take the place of the subject, and other pronouns will always take the place of the object. </p>
    <h2>What Are Pronouns, Subjects, and Objects? </h2>
    <div class="tabs">
    <a class="tab" title="header_title" >Pronouns</a>
    <div class="panel">
                   <p><strong>Pronouns</strong> are the words we use to replace nouns. For instance, if your name is Maria, it would be uncommon to say, “Maria wants some cookies.” Instead, you’ll probably say, “I want some cookies.” In this situation, “I” is a <strong>pronoun</strong>. It takes the place of the subject, Maria.</p>

    <a class="tab" title="header_title">Subjects and Objects</a>
    <div class="panel">
                     <p><strong>Subjects</strong> are the main idea of the sentence. They are the people or things performing the action. <strong>Objects</strong> receive the action of the sentence.</p>
   
 <p> Here is an example:</p>
 <p><a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="Jill is the subject. She performed the action of giving cookies away." data-trigger="hover">Jill</a> gave some cookies to <a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="Maria is the object. She received the cookies." data-trigger="hover">Maria</a>.

<p>Pronouns can get a bit tricky when there are multiple subjects and objects in a sentence. </p>

<h1>Colons and Semicolons</h1>
<p>What’s the difference between a colon and a semicolon? There are some easy tricks for remembering these.</p>

<div class="tabs">
    <a class="tab" title="header_title" >Colons</a>
    <div class="panel">
       
           <p><strong>Colons</strong> look like the top of a smiley face emoticon. They must appear at the end of a full thought, and they often introduce a list. You can imagine the colon means “and here it is” or “and here they are.”</p> 
<p> Here is an example:</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be one of three <a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="the comma reflects - and here they are" data-trigger="hover"><strong><em>things</em></strong></a>: a football quarterback, a ballet dancer, or a painter. </p>
    </div><!--End tab #1-->
    
    <a class="tab" title="header_title">Semicolons</a>
    <div class="panel">
          
           <p><strong>Semicolons</strong> look like the top of a winking face emoticon. They must appear in between two full thoughts that are related. Think of this punctuation mark as the sneaky one that allows you to write two sentences together without stopping&#8212;and&#8212;not get in trouble for using a run-on sentence! </p>
           <p> Here is an example:</p> 
           <p>Sometimes your plans <a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="semicolon helps sneak in another full sentence without having to end the thought" data-trigger="hover"><strong><em>change</em></strong>;</a> when I grew up, I decided to become a writer instead.</p>  
<p><strong>IMPORTANT REMINDER! To use a semicolon, your two full thoughts must be related. For example, you can’t write, “I became a writer; my dog likes cheese.”</strong></p>
