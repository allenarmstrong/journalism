	<h1>Conduct an Interview</h1>
<p>Interviewing is a tricky&#8212;but necessary&#8212;process that requires preparation and practice. To conduct a good interview, you need to do four things: </p>

							<p><strong>Ask open-ended questions instead of closed questions.</strong></p>
                            <p>Let's look at the difference:</p>
                            <p><strong>Closed Question:</strong><br><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="These are closed questions, with which the interviewee person being interviewed will generally answer 'Yes' or 'No,' and may not add anything else. Never count on your interviewee to add exciting information! It's your job as a reporter to draw that information out by asking open questions. " data-trigger="hover">Are you still unhappy with your job? <em>"No"</em></a></p>
                            <p><strong>Open-ended Question:</strong><br><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="Open-ended questions are essential for keeping an interview going. You want to avoid asking 'yes' or 'no' questions because they don't provide you with a lot of information to use and can often lead to a dead end. This is where open-ended questions come to the rescue." data-trigger="hover">What caused you to become happy with your job again? <em>"Well, it all started with one surprising event…"</em></a>

							<p><strong>Listen actively so you know what your interviewee is saying.</strong></p>
                            <p>You're never required to stick to your original list of questions. If you find out information that's more interesting than what you planned to discuss, feel free to explore the new topic by adding new questions as you go. Think of the interview as a conversation. If the interviewee has a story to tell, make sure you get the whole story. </p>

							<p><strong>Take good notes.</strong></p>
                            <p>You'll need to refer to your notes when you write your news story, and you'll want to quote your interviewees. This means you need direct, word-for-word notes about what the person said. Many reporters bring a voice recorder, as well as a computer or notepad to jot down thoughts.</p>
							<p><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="Place quotation marks around the quote itself and properly state the name of the person who made the statement. Make sure you get the correct spelling of the person's name!" data-trigger="hover">When you quote an interviewee, make sure the words are presented exactly as the person originally said them.</a>
                             <a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="It's common practice in the news industry to provide the full name of a source when quoted for the first time. However, if you quote that person again later in the same story, the last name is all you need. It is not common practice to refer to news subjects by their first names." data-trigger="hover">(style note)</a> </p>

							<p><strong>Avoid leading questions.</strong></p>
                            <p>During interviews, do your best to avoid leading the interviewee to say one thing or another. You should never interject your opinion into the conversation.</p>
                            <p class="text-center"><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="Would you say you liked the film because of its strong musical score or its amazing acting? This is a leading question. The reporter has made it clear that the interviewee should explain why the movie was good. But what if the interviewee didn't like the film at all? Avoid asking questions like this. " data-trigger="hover">Leading Questions</a></p>
                            <p class="text-center"><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="What were your thoughts about the film? This is a fair question. It allows the interviewee to respond honestly without being led to one opinion or another. Try to structure your interview questions this way." data-trigger="hover">Fair Questions</a></p>

<p>When someone you interview expresses opinion, it’s a good idea to find another interviewee who can offer the opposing point of view. This will lend credibility to your story. Whenever possible, gather information from several different kinds of people. If one person is in favor of an initiative, find someone else who isn’t and interview them both. </p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember that you are reporting information to people who may know very little about it. While you will use your research to become well versed in the details of your topic, you may still need to explain the basic facts to your audience.</p>
