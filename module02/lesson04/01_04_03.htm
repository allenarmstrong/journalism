	<h1>Traditional vs. Next Generation Journalism </h1>
As you can see, there are many different kinds of journalists, even in traditional settings. Outside of traditional settings, there are even more! 
<h2>Journalists Online</h2>

<div class="alert alert-warning">There are two images in this section of the current course – they will do fine here, or any other relevant images will be acceptable:
 img_mod01/01_05b_citizenreporter-lg.jpg</div><p>There are newspapers, magazines, radio channels, and television stations that exist entirely online. These news companies often employ full- and part-time journalists who report on different topics. Some sites have established fact-checking rules and codes of ethics that each member of the news staff must follow, while other sites do not. </p>

<li>What about people who work for organizations that don’t check facts? Are they journalists? </li></ul>

  </div></div>
  <h2>Citizen Journalists</h2>
<p>Finally, another important type of journalist to consider is the citizen journalist. These are average people who are normally not employed by any news company or organization. They see news and report on it by themselves, catching video or pictures with their own cameras and writing stories without the assistance of editors or fact checkers. Because these reporters are not held to specific journalism standards, the information they provide may be questionable.</p>
<p>Today, citizen journalists usually report their news via the Internet. This can be done with a blog, a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Vlog</strong>: Video blog" data-position="top">vlog</span>, a podcast, or other means of online communication. Because they do not work for any specific company, they are not held to standards of <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Accuracy</strong>: Correct facts" data-position="top">accuracy</span> or ethical reporting. </p>
Some major news organizations run stories generated by citizen journalists. Normally, the companies that run these stories will alert audiences ahead of time that the content is not fact-checked by their staff. In some situations, often involving major news stories, the news organization will contact the citizen journalist for more information and will perform the fact checking for them.

<p>By this point, you should be developing your own idea of what a journalist actually is. Remember that by its most basic definition, a journalist is someone who informs people about what is going on around him or her. What other qualifications must a person meet before he or she can be considered a true journalist? </p>

Pynn managed and edited a yearlong series of stories that won a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. Mike Thomas is a respected and award-winning journalist. They both agreed to share their thoughts about the journalism industry in an exclusive interview for this course.</p>
<p>For journalists, the delivery of accurate information is more than just a job. </p>
<p>"It's a very contentious enterprise," Pynn said. "And sometimes, I think that's what energizes us. When somebody's trying to stop us from doing something – which is basically inform the public – we get angry about that."</p>
