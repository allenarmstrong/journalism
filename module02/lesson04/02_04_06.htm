<h1>Avoiding Bias and Prejudice</h1>
<p>Your news story should be informative and free of your own opinion. Try to remain as impartial as possible, and avoid subjective wording that shows how you feel about the subject. </p>

			<td><strong>Example</strong></td>
		<td> In October 2014, the <em>South Florida Sun Sentinel </em>made a major change in its newsroom workflow. Rather than print all news for the newspaper and then pull interesting stories to post on its website, the publication started putting its news online first and then pulling stories from there for its print editions.</td>
			<td>The <em>South Florida Sun Sentinel’s</em> decision to change is a monumental shift that marks the future of journalism. Older writers should be worried because their skills are not as useful now that everything is improved with the digital focus. </td>

			<td><strong>Effect for Reader</strong></td>
		  <td>You have not shared your opinion, but instead simply shared information. Sticking to the facts is a good way to help your readers get the information they need to make up their minds about the topic. </td>
			<td>You have shared your feelings here. This is not an impartial report, and it is unfair to your readers if they are expecting you to remain free of bias. </td>

<p>Though your writing must be free of opinion, that doesn’t mean it has to be boring. Choose active verbs to make your story feel more immediate to the reader. Vary the length of your sentences, and use transitional phrases to introduce new topics within your story.</p>

<h2>Other Things to Consider</h2>
<p>While you’re avoiding words and phrases that indicate your opinion, you should also avoid anything that suggests a gender or cultural bias. This means you should not show preference for a specific kind of person in your writing. If you’re a female and you tend to only interview females and refer to information about females, you may be showing a gender bias. If you’re of a specific background and you tend to ignore members of other races and cultures in your writing, you may be showing a cultural prejudice. </p>
<p>By the same token, there’s no need to announce the race or gender of a person if that information is not essential to the story. </p>
<p>Remember that your audience includes everyone. Everyone should have a fair opportunity to learn the news you’ve gathered.</p>
<p>Finally, journalistic writing should be focused and concise. Think of the work you did to draft your lead sentence and paragraph. Let this style continue throughout your story so readers of almost all levels are able to understand your message. </p>
