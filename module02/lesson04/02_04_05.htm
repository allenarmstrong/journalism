<h1>Making Revisions</h1>
<p><strong><em>Um…why should I have to revise? It’s a first draft!</em></strong> </p>
<p>Good question, but first drafts are more than your error-ridden first attempt at writing. We all start off with something pretty rough when we first start writing, but before we can call it a polished first draft, we have to check for errors. </p>
<p><strong><em>Always remember: if you haven’t checked it for basic errors, it’s not ready for your teacher/editor to see it!</em></strong></p><p> Here are some important things to check before you submit your first draft. </p>

<h2>AP Stylebook</h2>
<p>The <em>Associated Press Stylebook</em> provides the main source of accepted writing guidelines for journalists. Many reporters keep this book at their desks, and copyeditors use it to check for certain rules, such as hyphens and capitalizations. Take a look at the <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/735/02/" class="pop" data-width="80%" data-height="80%">Purdue Online Writing Lab</a> for some important style rules you’ll need to follow.</p>
<p>Here are just a few examples of style guidelines that might interest you from this link:</p>

Commas and other necessary punctuation belong inside of quotation marks. (Eg. “The temperature is dropping much more quickly than usual,” the meteorologist said.) 3. Certain cities do not require a state to be listed after their names. You may list Atlanta and Dallas, as well as several others, on their own, but Orlando needs to have Florida after it. (Eg. In her life, she visited Chicago, Honolulu and Anaheim, California.)"

<p>There are many other useful rules that you can review to ensure your newswriting meets common journalistic standards.</p>
