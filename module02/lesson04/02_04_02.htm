<h1>Writing the First Draft</h1>
<img src="images/02_04_02_topimage_ts.png" alt="" class="showcase">
You’ve written your lead; now it’s time to write the rest. There are several steps you should follow to create a strong first draft for your news story:
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseOne">
        <h3 class="panel-title">Review your research.</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
     
      <p>Take notes about important facts and details, always making sure you jot down where you found this information. Remember, your readers will trust you more if you can prove you used reliable sources!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div> 
<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseTwo">
        <h3 class="panel-title">Conduct at least one interview.</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Being able to show the exact words a person had to say on your topic will add a lot to your story.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div> 
<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseThree">
        <h3 class="panel-title">Arrange your notes into the inverted pyramid.</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
      
      <p>This is kind of like creating an outline. You’ll take all your ideas and arrange them in order of importance so it’s easier to write your news story.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseFour">
        <h3 class="panel-title">Write your first draft.</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
    
      <p>Using your notes, you’ll write your story so it fits the inverted pyramid style.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseFive">
        <h3 class="panel-title">Check for any errors, and then revise!</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="collapseFive" class="collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>Before you submit a first draft, you must make sure it is free of basic errors. This includes factual errors, errors in grammar and spelling, and anything else you may need to correct.</p>
    </div>

Let’s get started!

<h1>Review Your Research</h1>
<p>You’ve pulled several credible sources for your news story. Now it’s time to read through them carefully.</p><p>Each one should offer you useful information that you can include in your news story.
Think of this like taking notes in class. When the teacher says something that might be on the test, you should write it down. Similarly, when your source explains something you might want to include in your story, you should copy it in your notes. </p>

<div class="well infobox">
    <div class="icon_local" data-icon="icon_expert"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Learn from Other Writers’ Mistakes!</h2>
        <p>Many writers have looked at their notes and forgotten what came from research and what came from their own minds. Often without meaning to, these writers have placed other people’s work into their own writing without <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Attributing:</strong> Giving credit to" data-position="top">attributing</span> the source. That’s a huge no-no. In fact, that’s plagiarism. No writer wants to be accused of stealing someone else’s work. 
To avoid this, make sure you always keep track of where you found your information. Otherwise, you could be called out later for plagiarism&#8212;even if it was an accident!</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Add evidence to your story by including direct quotations, summaries, or paraphrases from your research. The best examples of news use both <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Primary sources:</strong> Original documents, photographs, interviews" data-position="top">primary sources</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Secondary sources:</strong> Information that was interpreted by someone else" data-position="top">secondary sources</span>. </p>
<p>Most news writing cites sources using attribution. Here are some examples of how this might work in a typical story:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped table-hover">
	
    <tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Integrated Direct Quotation</strong></td>
			<td><strong>According to a Poynter article by Kristen Hare about the <em>South Florida Sun Sentinel</em></strong>, "everyone but a designated team will focus solely on reporting and producing news online.” </td>
			
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Summary Statement</strong></td>
			<td><strong>A Poynter article about the <em>South Florida Sun Sentinel</em> describes the shift from producing news primarily for print to producing news primarily for online publication.</strong></td>
			
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td><strong>Paraphrase Statement</strong></td>
		  <td>The <em>South Florida Sun Sentinel </em>has changed its workflow process to publish online first and then create a print newspaper from its online stories, <strong>according to an article on Poynter.org.</strong></td>
		  
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
