<h1>Use the Inverted Pyramid</h1>
	
    <p>Once you’ve gathered your research and interview notes, it’s time to arrange everything in the inverted pyramid. This is a great way to outline your news story so it follows a strong journalistic style.</p><p> 
Use this template to collect your notes in order. You should begin with the most important information and work your way down to lesser topics as you go. </p>

<h1>Writing the First Draft</h1>
<p>Using your outline in the inverted pyramid, you can get started writing. At this point, you should determine whether you are using a <strong>formal</strong> or an <strong>informal</strong> style. </p><div class="clearfix"></div>

Formal writing is what you see in most standard news stories. It expresses information about topics that may be considered important to the community. Think of <em>The New York Times</em>, CNN, and NPR. Most parts of these news organizations will use formal writing.
<ul><li>Formal writing does NOT use contractions.</li>
<li>Formal writing does NOT use slang.</li>
<li>Formal writing does NOT sound conversational.</li></ul>

  </div><!--End tab #1-->
  
  <a class="tab" title="header_title"><strong>Informal Writing</strong></a>

<div class="panel">
     
Informal writing is much more conversational. This often expresses information about “gossip” topics, such as celebrity news, or some sports stories. Think of TMZ, ESPN, and <em>Cracked Magazine</em>. 
<ul><li>Informal writing doesn’t have a problem with contractions.</li>
<li>Informal writing’s cool with slang.
</li>
<li>And, yeah, informal writing can be conversational.</li></ul>

You will have to decide which type of news story you’re writing. However, there are some guidelines that all good writing should follow: 
<ul><li>Both formal and informal news writing use complete sentences.</li>
<li>Both formal and informal news writing use paragraphs.</li>
<li>Both formal and informal news writing use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.</li></ul>
Most importantly, remember the following tip: <em><strong>All news writing should be clear for the reader to understand.</strong></em></div>
