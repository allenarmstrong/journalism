	<h2>Pronoun Helpful Hints</h2>
     
  <p>If you need to make a decision about which pronoun to use quickly, there’s a fast trick you can use:</p> 
<p><strong>Imagine the sentence without the other person in it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiple subjects:</strong> (She, Her) and (I, me) will get some cookies from Jill. </p>
<p><em>Would you say "Her will get some cookies from Jill" or "She will get some cookies from Jill"?
Would you say “Me will get some cookies from Jill” or “I will get some cookies from Jill”?</em> </p>
<p>“She and I will get some cookies from Jill.”</p>
<p><strong>Multiple objects:</strong> Jill will give some cookies to (she, her) and (I, me). </p>
<p><em>Would you say "Jill will give some cookies to me" or "Jill will give some cookies to I"?
Would you say “Jill will give some cookies to she” or “Jill will give some cookies to her”?</em></p>
<p> “Jill will give some cookies to her and me.”  </p>
<p>This trick will work every time. </p></div>
