	<h2>Subject/Verb Agreement Refresher</h2>
     
      <p>The reason I bought all of these toys and gifts <strong>(is/are)</strong> that I have several cousins with birthdays in the same month.</p>
<p>What is the subject of this sentence? Is it <strong>reason</strong>, or is it <strong>toys and gifts</strong>? To determine the correct answer, you need to look at what the sentence is truly about. Is the person trying to give special information about the toys and gifts, or is the person trying to explain the reason? </p>

      <p><p>In this sentence, <strong>reason</strong> is the subject. Because there is only one reason, that means it’s singular. To make the verb agree with this subject, it must also be singular. That means the correct sentence should read:</p>
<p>The <strong>reason</strong> I bought all of these toys and gifts <strong>is</strong> that I have several cousins with birthdays in the same month.</p>
<p>Review this as many times as you need to. Do you have a better understanding of agreement? </p>    </div>
