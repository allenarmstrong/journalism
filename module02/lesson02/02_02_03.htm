  <h1>Leading with Brevity </h1>
  <p>Audiences want your lead sentence to have <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Brevity:</strong> Be short, simple, and to the point" data-position="top">brevity</span>. This means you need to answer as many of your questions in one sentence&#8212;ideally in about 20 to 30 words. How can you do this? With lots of practice. </p>


  

  <p>Here’s an example: </p>
  <!--<img src="images/02_02_03_newsimage1_ts.png" alt="" class="pull-left">-->
  <div class="paperbox">The mayor attended the opening of a new community center on Main Street today at 9 a.m. that will allow local kids and parents to take free classes on a range of topics from afterschool tutoring to financial planning. </div>
  <p>This lead is 40 words long. Can you see that it gets a little confusing as the writer tries to pack lots of information into a small space? Instead of helping readers get the important details, the writer actually made it more difficult to understand the essential information. Let’s ask some questions about the lead.</p>
  <div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseOne">
        <h3 class="panel-title"><strong>Who</strong> are the key players?</h3>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p> <strong>WHO?</strong>: The mayor, who attended the opening, and the public, who will use the facility. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseTwo">
        <h3 class="panel-title"><strong>What</strong> are the most important details? </h3>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p><strong>WHAT?</strong>: There are free classes available at the new community center that just opened.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseThree">
        <h3 class="panel-title"><strong>When</strong> will this or did this take place? </h3>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p><strong>WHEN?</strong>: It happened today at 9 a.m.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseFour">
        <h3 class="panel-title"><strong>Where</strong> is the new community center? </h3>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p><strong>WHERE?</strong>: The new community center is on Main Street where kids and parents can take advantage of its programs.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseFive">
        <h3 class="panel-title"><strong>Why</strong> does this story matter? </h3>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseFive" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p><strong>WHY?</strong>: It matters because there is a new community center that the public can use for free.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseSix">
        <h3 class="panel-title"><strong>How</strong> is the public going to be affected? </h3>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseSix" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p><strong>HOW?</strong>: The public will be able to take free courses.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Using these details, the writer should be able to tighten up this sentence. Let's look at the lead again:</p>
  <!--<img src="images/02_02_03_newsimage2_ts.png" alt="" class="pull-left">-->
   <div class="paperbox">The mayor attended the opening of a <a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="If it’s opening, it’s probably safe to assume it’s also new." data-trigger="hover">new</a> community center on Main Street today at 9 a.m. <a class="popover" data-position="right" data-content="How about “for” instead of “that will allow?”"  data-trigger="hover">that will allow</a> local kids and parents to take free classes on a range of topics from afterschool tutoring to financial planning.</div>
  <p>That’s a good start! Take a look at how the sentence has changed:</p>
  <!--<img src="images/02_02_03_newsimage3_ts.png" alt="" class="pull-left">-->
    <div class="paperbox">The mayor attended the opening of a Main Street community center today at 9 a.m. for local kids and parents to take free classes on a range of topics from afterschool tutoring to financial planning.</div>
  <p>This lead is still long at 36 words, and it’s still a bit confusing:</p><ul><li>Did the mayor attend the opening so that local kids and parents could take free classes? </li><li>Does the community center offer the free classes? </li></ul><p>Your lead sentence should be as clear as possible so there’s no misunderstanding. </p>
  <p>At this point you should start looking at what parts of this story aren’t completely necessary. It’s up to you, as the reporter, to decide what the public most likely needs to know first.</p>
  <p>For example, what happens if you remove the mayor from the lead sentence?</p>
  <!--<img src="images/02_02_03_newsimage4_ts.png" alt="" class="pull-left">-->
  <div class="paperbox"> A Main Street community center opened up today at 9 a.m. for local kids and parents to take free classes on a range of topics from afterschool tutoring to financial planning.</div>
  <p>Thirty-two words! Getting closer. Now you should consider what the most important part of this lead is. </p>
    <!--<img src="images/02_02_03_newsimage5_ts.png" alt="" class="pull-left">-->
  <div class="paperbox">Local residents of all ages may now take free classes on a range of topics at the Main Street community center that opened up today at 9 a.m.</div>
    
	<p>Under 30 words! Amazing! <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Subsequent:</strong> Later" data-position="top">Subsequent</span> sentences in the lead paragraph can state other facts, such as the types of classes the center will offer and the mayor’s attendance at the opening.</p>
  <p>Notice that the reporter has done a good job of remaining impartial. Your opinion should never show in a straight news story.</p>
 <div class="well infobox">
    <div class="icon_local" data-icon="icon_infobox"></div>
    <div class="content">
       
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> While this sentence may meet the basic requirements of a “good” lead, there’s always room for improvement. Challenge yourself to write a better lead every time.</p>
