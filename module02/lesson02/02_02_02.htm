	<h1>The Questions: WWWWWH</h1>
    <p>Once you’ve gathered research, it’s time to start working on your news story. But how do you begin? </p>
   <img src="images/02_02_02_infographic_ts.png" alt="Start by asking the 5Ws and one H: Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How. " class="normal">
   <div class="clearfix"></div>	
<p>You must answer as many of these as possible in your opening sentence. That’s a lot to include, but it’ll hook your audience from the start! </p>
<h1>Then and Now</h1>
<p>Take a look at these two examples of news writing. The first comes from Publick Occurences, the first newspaper ever published in the colonies, in 1690. </p>

   <div class="row">
   		<div class="col-md-6"><img src="images/02_02_02_a_po_ts.png" alt="Another late matter of diſcourſe, has been an unaccountable deſtruction befalling a body of <em>Indians</em>, that were our Enemies. This body of <em>French Indians</em> had a Fort ſomewhere far up the River, and a party of <em>Maqua's </em>returning from the <em>Eaſt Country</em>, where they have a great rate purſued and terrified those Indians which have been invading of our <em>North-Eaſt Plantations</em>, and Killed their General <em>Hope Hood</em> among the reſt; reſolved to viſit this Fort; but they found the Fort ruined, the Canoo's cut to pieces, and the people all either Butchered or Captived, This gave them no little ſurprize, and they give the <em>Engliſh</em> this accounts of it.  " class="top-flush">	</div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
              <div class="audiobox">
                  <div class="htmltext_version audioInteractive" data-src="textversion/020202textverision.htm">

                  </div>
              </div>
              <p>This was probably a little tough to understand. Even without the changes in spelling, this news story didn't answer the 5Ws and one H in the lead. Instead, it read more like a conversation, with important information appearing later in the paragraph.</p> 
        </div>

<p>Compare that with this news story from the Associated Press in 2013. Pay close attention to the lead in this story. How has it improved on the older format? How could you improve on it now?</p>

<p>At issue in the case before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals are the long distances some Indians in rural areas of the state must travel to reach county courthouses for early voting and late registration.</p>
<p>While not as blatant as past discriminatory practices against Indians — who were once denied the vote outright — the difficulties some tribal members face reaching election offices puts them at a disadvantage to white voters, the government and plaintiffs said.</p>
