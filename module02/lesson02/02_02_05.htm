    <p>For this <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>, you must draft a lead sentence for your news story about your chosen career in journalism. Your sentence must meet the following requirements:</p>
    <ol><li>It must be between 20 and 30 words long.</li>
<li>It must address at least three of the WWWWWH questions.</li>
<li>It must not express opinion.</li></ol>

  <p> In your <a href="../docs/reporternotebook.htm" class="pop">Reporter’s Notebook</a> complete Part Two by writing your lead sentence, and then explain how it meets all three requirements. </p>
<p>Your instructor will approve your lead or give you feedback on how to improve it. </p>
<p>You do not need to begin writing your news story about your chosen career. However, make sure you are keeping track of your ideas and information so you are ready!</p>
