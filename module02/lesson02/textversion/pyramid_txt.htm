You know the story of the three little pigs, right? One pig makes a house of straw, another of sticks, and another of bricks. A hungry wolf comes and blows them all down&#8212;except for the house made of bricks, which was strong enough to save the pigs. </p>

<p>Let’s report the events using the inverted pyramid, where the most important information comes first. </p>

<p>The lead sentence in a news report gives you everything you need to know. It answers the 5Ws and one H as quickly and clearly as possible. Here’s an example:</p>


<p>A hungry wolf used his breath to destroy two homes and damage another in the Pig Pen community, before fleeing the scene late Saturday.</p>

<p>The next paragraph should expand on the information in the lead sentence, providing  specific details for readers who want to know more, like this: </p>


<p>All residents are safe. The families who fled said the wolf huffed and puffed and blew down their homes made of straw and sticks, but was unable to blow down the house made of bricks. The hungry wolf attempted to enter the brick structure through the chimney but ran away after encountering a fire. </p>

<p>Moving down the pyramid, the information becomes less important. The details in the following paragraph are nice-to-know, but not need-to-know:  </p>


<p>Mr. Pork Bacon, owner of the brick house, said the wolf knocked on his door, saying, “Little pig, little pig, let me come in.” Bacon responded, “No, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin.” Directly after, the wolf tried to gain access to Bacon’s home via the chimney. </p>

<p>The least important information comes last. The following details are relevant to the story but not necessary: </p>




<p>“It was traumatic,” said Mrs. Bacon. “I’m just happy we’re all safe.” The other families of Pig Pen have agreed to rebuild their homes with bricks.</p>
<p>Remember, news editors will make cuts to a story from the bottom up, so make sure your article always has a strong lead sentence and first paragraph.</p>
