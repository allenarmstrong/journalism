Another late matter of discourse has been an unaccountable destruction befalling a body of Indians that were our Enemies. This body of French Indians had a Fort somewhere far up the River, and a party of Maqua's returning from the East Country, where they have a great rate pursued and terrified those Indians which have been invading of our North-East Plantations, and Killed their General Hope Hood among the rest; resolved to visit this Fort; but they found the Fort ruined, the Canoe's cut to pieces, and the people all either Butchered or Captived, This gave them no little surprise, and they give the English this account of it.
