	<h1>The Inverted Pyramid</h1>
    <p>Remember that audiences expect to learn first thing what’s happening and how it relates to their lives. Save other interesting details for later paragraphs. This type of writing is known as the <strong>inverted pyramid</strong>. </p>
<p>The inverted pyramid structure may require you to outline your news stories differently than you would other types of writing. This video will tell you everything you need to get started! </p>
<p>You’re probably used to writing a thesis statement and then moving on to list supporting points in your essays for school. In news stories, you take another approach. Using the inverted pyramid, begin with the important details and work your way down to lesser topics later on. </p>
