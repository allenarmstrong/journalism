  <li>This is a really bad story. Sorry. It just is. I didn’t learn anything important. Are you sure you got enough information to make this work?</li>

  <li>Interesting story! There were several places where I had questions about the facts. Maybe you could gather some more information? I’ve marked the places where I wanted to know more. </li>

  <li>I think you’re missing a lot of commas.</li>

  <li>Wow. It’s pretty obvious you don’t like television from this story. Watch out for that prejudice.</li>

  <li>I detected some hints of opinion at some points in this story. It’s hard to avoid, isn’t it? The places where I thought you could work on this are marked. I hope this helps.</li>
