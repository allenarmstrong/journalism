  <h1>Informative Writing</h1>
<p>As you get ready to complete your news story, pay close attention to the way information is presented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Does it have a strong lead?</li>
  <li> Is it free of bias?    </li>
  <li>Has the writer avoided typos and errors?    </li>
  <li>Does the story follow the inverted pyramid? </li>
</ul>
    You may also want to review informative writing before you finish your news story. Here’s a quick refresher about the ways we can inform readers about important topics: 
    
   <h2> Content Editing and Copyediting</h2>
<p>Once you’ve completed a first draft, it’s time to make revisions! For some writers, this is the process that transforms an idea into a polished piece that’s ready for print.</p>
<p>Newspaper journalists normally first submit their work to their editor, who checks the story’s overall content. After that may go to a copyeditor, who will check for any errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and style. Finally, the design team may request some length and style adjustments before the story is ready to go to print. The reporter must be prepared to make quick changes as necessary throughout this process. After all, there is a deadline, and the paper needs to get out!</p>

        <h2>Expert's Corner</h2>
        <p>As budgets grow tighter, this is starting to change. Manning Pynn said, "We used to insist that nothing got in the paper without at least three sets of editing eyes on it, and usually more than that." 
Mike Thomas explained that the cost of editors and proofreaders is leading some news organizations to lose significant parts of their editing force. "You have a content editor who oversees you directly, and it'll go through two copyeditors – and this is in the old days – and then layout editor, then they would take the first run, and everybody would read it again. Well, that process has been trimmed back because it's a luxury that's no longer affordable."

<p>If you choose to collaborate, you’ll go through a similar process with your news story. Not only will you share your first draft with another student, but you will contribute your own feedback to another writer.</p>
<p>To take part in this process, you must understand several things about self-editing, providing constructive criticism, and receiving constructive criticism. </p>

<h2>Self-Editing </h2>
Before you submit your draft to someone for comments, you should give it a close look to make sure it’s free of excessive errors. Your writing doesn't have to be perfect, but it should be clear, correct, and follow the basic guidelines of journalistic writing. 

        <p>Perhaps there’s an interesting visual way to show this information?</p>
<p><input type=“checkbox”>Read your story aloud: Do the sentences make sense? Is there a simpler way you could organize or word them? </p>
<p><input type=“checkbox”>Check your grammar and punctuation: Consult a grammar book or website to help you with tricky rules.</p>
<p><input type=“checkbox”>Fact check: Double check the spelling of any names you’ve used, as well as the facts, locations, and dates. </p>
<ul>
  <li>  NOTE: If you write about someone who has a name with an unusual spelling or if your story includes a fact that seems strange, check it several times before submitting the draft. When you are sure you have everything correct, put “(cq)” next to the questionable item. This means that you’ve checked and verified it. Example: Store owner Sandruh (cq) Miller has lived on Main Street for 53 years.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><input type=“checkbox”>Check for bias: Take a careful look at your story for anything that may suggest opinion, bias, or prejudice. Remove or change instances of these problems.</p>
<p><input type=“checkbox”>Inverted pyramid: Check to make sure you’ve used the inverted pyramid. </p>
