<h1>Providing Constructive Criticism: The Collaboration Opportunity </h1>
<p>Take a look at the following information if you are interested in doing the collaboration opportunity for this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. Remember, you must complete one per <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span>. </p>
<p>When you feel your story’s ready, it’s time to exchange with another student. You will submit your writing for feedback and will receive a story to critique in return. <strong>It is your responsibility to provide your classmate a useful review of his or her writing. </strong></p>
<p>Use this <a href="../docs/ccchecklist.htm" class="pop" data-width="80%" data-height="80%">Constructive Criticism Checklist </a>when you provide constructive criticism.</p>
<p>Another important skill to develop is inserting and reading track changes in your word-processing program. Check the details for your program to determine how you can insert comments into text documents and how you can review, accept, or reject changes. </p>

<h1>The Three P's</h1>
<p>Keep in mind how much time and energy you’ve put into your own writing. When you receive someone else’s story, remember that he or she has also worked hard to prepare that draft. There’s always room for improvement, but every comment you write should follow the Three P’s:</p>

<div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" data-target="#collapseTwo">
            <h4 class="panel-title">Professional</h4>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
         
           <p>Imagine that you’re the copyeditor at a newspaper, and this story has just reached your computer screen. Just as the writer had to leave out opinion, bias, and prejudice, you must leave out your own personal feelings in your review. Treat every error or suggestion as a straightforward situation that has nothing to do with the writer’s intelligence or abilities. You’re simply there to provide helpful feedback so the writer can improve his or her story.</p>

           <p>Everyone’s more receptive when feedback seems friendly. While you must do your best to avoid getting personal in your comments, you should also use words that have a positive tone whenever possible. This makes even the strongest criticism easier to take. If you’re unsure how a comment is going to come across, ask friends or family members first how they might feel if you said the comment to them. When in doubt, be a little nicer.</p>

           <p>Your partner is looking for valuable feedback in order to improve his or her writing. Ask yourself before you finish reviewing whether you’ve helped the writer produce something better than the first draft. Comments should include mentions of things you liked in the story, as well as areas for improvement. Be as specific as possible so the writer can make changes. This is the most productive way to work, as the writer will know what to do more of and what to revise.</p>

<p>Important note: The process of reviewing another person’s writing may be more beneficial than you expect. Viewing a partner’s work will allow you to make a mental note of things that work and things that don’t. You can carry these observations over into your own revisions!</p>
<h1>Receiving Constructive Criticism </h1>
<p>When you get your story back, you must read your partner’s comments with an open mind. If your partner didn't understand something, it's possible you should adjust your writing to clarify the information. This is a normal and necessary part of the newswriting process. </p>
<p>You don’t have to agree with or <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Implement:</strong> Use or carry out" data-position="top">implement</span> every comment your partner gives you. If you choose to ignore a note, though, be prepared to explain to your instructor why you felt it was unnecessary. </p>
