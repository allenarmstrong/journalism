<h1>Overview</h1>
Throughout this Journalism course, you will have opportunities to collaborate with your fellow classmates. View the <a href="//cdn.flvs.net/cdn/lo/collaboration_hs/index.htm" class="external-link">Collaboration Presentation</a> to get tips and guidelines for working together.
<p><strong>You are required to submit one collaboration assessment in each segment.</strong> If you choose to collaborate more than once, you will earn credit for only one collaboration activity.</p>
<h1>Synchronous Collaboration</h1>
Contact your instructor to learn about collaboration opportunities that will allow you to interact with your classmates online, in real-time, using Web 2.0 tools. If you choose to participate in the synchronous collaboration opportunity, your instructor will explain what you need to submit for grading.
<h1>Asynchronous Collaboration</h1>
<p>In this <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span>, you also have the opportunity to participate in an asynchronous collaboration with one of your classmates. To participate in this collaboration, use the discussion board and/or email feature of the course to send a message to your classmates to find a peer review partner. Once you have found someone to work with, you will send your writing, and your classmate will review it using the <strong>Guide for Peer Review</strong> provided in the lesson.</p>
