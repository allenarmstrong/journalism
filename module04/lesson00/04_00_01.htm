    <h1>Argument Writing</h1>
      
<p>Arguments are everywhere. Advertisements argue the value of a product to tell us how we should think and feel. Politicians put forth <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Claims:</strong> An assertion of the truth of something, typically one that is disputed or in doubt" data-position="top">claims</span> against their opponents. Your best friend may even make her case about why you should try out for the swim team. There are persuasive messages everywhere—even in the news!</p>

<p>Think of your local newspaper. There are multiple sections for various topics, including local news, national news, editorials, sports, entertainment reviews, and more. Some of these sections include opinion, and some do not. How can you tell the difference?</p>

<p>Newspapers often divide their sections so you can tell the difference between opinion writing and impartial writing, but what about other news sources where you cannot see the divisions?</p>

<p>Think about your favorite radio news shows, television news channels, or online news sites. </p>

        <li>Look at previous reports to determine whether the writer often expresses opinion.</li>
        <li>Look or listen for sources; has the reporter provided them to support his or her evidence?</li>

<p>Methods of persuasion are not confined to advertising. Commercials offer strong messages: <em>We want you to buy our product. We think our product is best. That other product makes false claims about what it can do.</em> While news and other sources of information also often include opinion, sometimes it is difficult to tell what is true and what is not. </p>

<p>If the messages from commercials reach and influence our community so easily, what happens when news organizations begin to blend fact and opinion? Welcome to the world of argument writing.</p>
