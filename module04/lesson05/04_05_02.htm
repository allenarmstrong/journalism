<h1>Who Writes Opinion?</h1>

<p>While traditional journalism is meant to be impartial, there are many journalists whose job requires them to express their opinion all the time. Each one has a slightly different approach to writing. </p>
<p>You already have a topic and research, but do you know what type of opinion piece is best for your topic and your writing style?</p>

<p>Take a look at these examples to get a better idea:</p>

    <a class="tab" title="" >Editorials</a>
    <div class="panel">
    	<p><strong>Editorials</strong> are one of the most common types of opinion writing in news. They cover current events and offer more insight into news stories by showing how writers feel about what's going on. </p>
		<p>Here are some basic details that can help you understand the traditional editorial:</p>
        <ul><li>Answers the 5Ws and one H</li>
        <li>Gets the audience's interest, explains the issue, and takes a side</li> 
        <li>Can be serious or humorous </li></ul>
        <p>
        To write a traditional editorial, follow this structure:</p>
        <ul><li>Introduce the topic.</li>
        <li>State your claim.</li>
        <li>Report the basics of your research. </li>
        <li>State the counterclaim.</li>
        <li>Provide the rebuttal using more details from research. This section should offer alternatives to the counterclaim. </li>
        <li>Conclude the editorial by stating your claim based on the research you provided. </li></ul>
        <p> Traditional Editorials can use different angles to get their message across:</p><ul>
          <li>What Just Happened&mdash;This type of editorial looks back at a current event that has just recently taken place. The argument may state that the outcome was the wrong one, or it may show that the result of the event was positive. The writer will be fair to both sides of the issue but will still explain why readers should believe the claim. </li><li>	What's Coming Next&mdash;This type of editorial looks ahead and makes predictions about what people can expect to happen soon. The argument may state that, unless people take the writer's advice, something bad is likely to happen, or the argument may show that change is coming no matter what and the writer knows the best way to deal with that change. Writers will be fair to both sides of the issue but still explain why readers should believe their claim. </li></ul>

    <a class="tab" title="">Sports</a>
    <div class="panel">
    	<p><strong>Sports</strong> journalists have a particular style that is unique in the newsroom. They provide editorial content – that is, opinion-based reporting – while covering athletic events to help audiences make sense of the games or competitions that have taken place. </p>
		<p>Here are some basic details that can help you understand sports opinion writing:</p>
        <ul><li>Answers the 5Ws and one H</li>
        <li>Gets the audience's interest, explains the issue, and adds analysis </li>
        <li>Can be serious or humorous </li></ul>
        
        <p>To write a sports opinion piece, follow this structure:</p>
        <ul><li>Introduce the topic.</li>
        <li>State your claim.</li>
        <li>Report the basics of your research. This should include who won or lost, if that is part of your topic.  </li>
        <li>Go beyond the outcome of the game to discuss what's important about the topic. Tell your audience why this is valuable to them. </li>
        <li>Discuss the counterclaim. Be aware of what people are saying about this topic, and be fair to their views. </li>
        <li>Provide the rebuttal by analyzing your research in more detail. </li>
        <li>Conclude your opinion by stating your claim based on the research you provided. </li></ul>
        
        <p>Sports opinion writers must demonstrate knowledge: </p>
        <ul><li>Rules&#8212;Sports writers must understand the rules of the game, as well as the rules of the organization that governs the game. </li>
        <li>History&#8212;Many sports writers will benefit from understanding the history of the game they're covering, including important players of the past, exciting games and their outcomes, and notable changes in rules. </li>
        <li>People&#8212;The players, managers, and coaches are all of interest to sports news audiences. Sports writers should be familiar with the people they're writing about and what details the public will want to know. </li></ul>

    <a class="tab" title="">Art Critics</a>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>People turn to <strong>art critics </strong>for many reasons. These pieces provide editorial content&#8212;that is, opinion-based reporting&#8212;that can teach the public about art, provide suggestions about which movies to see, critique flawed productions, and more. </p>
		<p>Here are some basic details that can help you understand arts criticism:</p>
        <ul><li>Answers the 5Ws and one H</li>
        <li>Gets the audience's interest, explains what you observed, and provides evaluation </li>
        <li>Can be serious or humorous </li></ul> 
        <p>To write a review, follow this structure:</p>
        <ul><li>Introduce the topic. </li>
        <li>State your claim. </li>
        <li>Provide some details about the event. If it's a film, share some researched facts about the story, the director, the actors, or other interesting information that will get your audience's attention.  </li>
        <li>Discuss the counterclaim. Be aware of what people are saying about this topic, and be fair to their views. </li>
        <li>Provide the rebuttal by analyzing your own experience in more detail. </li>
        <li>Conclude your opinion by stating your claim based on your observation, as well as the research you provided. </li>
        <li>Report the basics of your research. This should include where and when the public can go to the event.  </li></ul>
        
        <p>Arts critics must take certain things into consideration:</p> 
        <ul><li>Being Fair&#8212;Even though you're reporting your opinion, it's important to remember to be fair. If you go to a film that you don't think is funny, but everyone in the audience is cracking up laughing, you must be honest in your report. Tell your audience you didn't laugh, but everyone else did.  </li>
        <li>Brutal Honesty&#8212;When critiquing the arts, brutal honesty is often looked at as a kind of "cheap shot." You want to tell your audience the truth, but if you are truly unkind in your review, this can give you the reputation of a mean writer and it may turn audiences against you.  </li>
        <li>Research Matters&#8212;Even though a critic relies mainly on his or her own observation to write a review, there is still a need to do research. The more you know about your topic, its history, and its people, the better you will be able to provide a fair and thorough evaluation.  </li></ul>
