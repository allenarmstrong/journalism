<h1>Sentence Structure</h1>
<p>Journalists strive to keep their news stories clear and to the point. One way to do this is to vary your sentence structure. </p>
<p>Your writing will become most effective when you use several different types of sentences. Some should be short, while others should be longer and more complex. There are four basic types of sentences you can use in your writing. As you write your rough draft, try to use them all.
