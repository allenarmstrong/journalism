<h1>04.05 The Rebuttal&#8211;Text Version</h1>
<p>When you write the rebuttal to your opinion piece, it's really important to first consider your claim and counterclaim. </p>

<p>Think of it this way—you wouldn't tell a story without a main character, or take a picture without a subject, right?</p>

<p>Your claim is the foundation of your argument—it's the main point. Without it, your opinion is lost!</p>

<p>Your counterclaim is equally important. This is where you bring up the opposition to your claim. A good argument always shows both sides and lets the reader decide which one to believe. </p>

<p>Your rebuttal will respond to the counterclaim. This is where you will disagree with the opposing side. To write a clear rebuttal, you must negate the counterclaim and say WHY. </p>

<p>A strong rebuttal should leave your audience with a clear understanding of your position. To give it credibility, include evidence such as researched facts, specific details, historical information, or quotes from reliable sources.</p>

<p>Remember, the details of your rebuttal will depend on your stance, or opinion. </p>

<p>If you are challenging someone else's opinion, provide evidence to back it up. </p>

<p>If you are challenging assumptions, explain why they don't hold up. </p>

<p>So when you write your rebuttal to prove your point, make sure you can support it.  </p>
