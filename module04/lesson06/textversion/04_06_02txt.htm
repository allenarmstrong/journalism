    <h1>Final Draft&mdash;Text Version</h1>
    <h2>Claim</h2>
			<p>Your argument should include a claim that states your opinion.</p><p><em>Example:</em> All schools should serve both breakfast and lunch to students. </p>
    <h2>Counterclaim</h2>
          <p>Make sure you have been fair to your audience by sharing counterclaims that honestly show what the opposite side of your topic believes.<br><br><em>Example:</em> Budget and time restrictions make serving two meals a day difficult in many schools.     </p>
    <h2>Research</h2>    
          <p>It's important to show your audience that you've done your research. The more you know about this topic, the more informed your opinion will seem.
		  <br><br><em>Example:</em> According to the study, X% of money every school year goes to creating lunches alone. </p>
    <h2>Rebuttal</h2>  
    	  <p>After you've addressed the counterclaim, it's time to provide your rebuttal. This is where you should show&mdash;through research and your own observations&mdash;why your claim is the correct position. <BR><BR><em>Example:</em> However, this study shows a significant increase in student health and success when nutritious breakfasts are introduced. </p>               
    <h2>Sentence Structure</h2>        
          <p>Read your sentences. Do you have several short ones that could be combined? Do you have several long thoughts in a row that should be broken up? Readers like to see variety in your sentence structure. That's a key to good writing. Give it a try in your revisions!</p>
    <h2>5 W<span class="nocaps">s</span> and one  H</h2>
          <p>Check your reporting. You should strive to answer the 5 W<span class="nocaps">s</span> and one H through your research and observations.
          <br><strong>Who</strong>: Students and schools / <strong>What</strong>: Breakfast / <strong>When</strong>: Mornings on school days / <strong>Where</strong>: All schools / <strong>Why</strong>: Increased health and academic performance / <strong>How</strong>: Budget and schedule shifts<br>
          Put your researched answers to all questions into sentence form, and use them in your argument. </p>
    <h2>Reader Interest</h2> 
          <p>Use details that your audience will find interesting. In your research and interviews, you will likely notice a "human interest" element or a surprising statistic. Include this in your argument if it fits with your writing style, and your readers will pay close attention! 
          <br><br><em>Example:</em> Joey hasn't had breakfast in two years. "It's not so bad until I get to third period," he said. "That's when I'm so hungry I can't concentrate at all."</p>		    <h2>Offer Suggestions</h2>       
          <p>Let your conclusion show audiences what they can do next. You might offer suggestions for how the problem can be resolved, or you might leave readers with something to think about. Try to do more than simply point out a problem; show readers how they can start to fix that problem. </p>
