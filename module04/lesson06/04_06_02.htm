<h1>Final Draft</h1>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>You have planned, researched, and written a first draft of your editorial. That’s an amazing accomplishment! </p>
<p>Now it’s time to revise your work. Your final draft should show major revision changes from your first draft, and it will be a much better product. Keep the following things in mind as you work through your revisions: </p>

<div class="htmltext_version" data-src="textversion/04_06_02txt.htm">
   <div class="tabs" data-position="left">
    <a class="tab claim" title="header title inside content area" ><br>Claim</a>
    <div class="panel">
    <div class="grid">
    <figure class="effect-bubba">
		<img src="images/final_draft1_ts.png" alt="img1"/>				
        <figcaption>
			<h2>Claim</h2>
			<p>Your argument should include a claim that states your opinion.</p><p><em>Example:</em> All schools should serve both breakfast and lunch to students. </p>

    <a class="tab counter" title="header title inside content area">Counter-<br>claim</a>
    <div class="panel">
    <div class="grid">
    <figure class="effect-bubba">
		<img src="images/final_draft2_ts.png" alt="img2"/>				
        <figcaption>
          <h2>Counterclaim</h2>
          <p>Make sure you have been fair to your audience by sharing counterclaims that honestly show what the opposite side of your topic believes.<br><br><em>Example:</em> Budget and time restrictions make serving two meals a day difficult in many schools.</p>
    </figcaption>

    <figure class="effect-bubba">

        <figcaption>
          <h2>Research</h2>    
          <p>It’s important to show your audience that you’ve done your research. The more you know about this topic, the more informed your opinion will seem.
		  <br><br><em>Example:</em> According to the study, X% of money every school year goes to creating lunches alone. </p>

    <a class="tab rebuttal" title="header title inside content area"><br>Rebuttal</a>
    <div class="panel">
    <div class="grid">
    <figure class="effect-bubba">
		<img src="images/final_draft4_ts.png" alt="img4"/>				
        <figcaption>
          <h2>Rebuttal</h2>  <p>After you’ve addressed the counterclaim, it’s time to provide your rebuttal. This is where you should show&mdash;through research and your own observations&mdash;why your claim is the correct position. <BR><BR><em>Example:</em> However, this study shows a significant increase in student health and success when nutritious breakfasts are introduced. </p>

    <div class="panel">
    <div class="grid">
    <figure class="effect-bubba">
		<img src="images/final_draft5_ts.png" alt="img5"/>				
        <figcaption>
          <h2>Sentence &nbsp; Structure</h2>        
          <p>Read your sentences. Do you have several short ones that could be combined? Do you have several long thoughts in a row that should be broken up? Readers like to see variety in your sentence structure. That’s a key to good writing. Give it a try in your revisions!</p>

        <figcaption>
          <h2>5 W<span class="nocaps">s</span> &nbsp; and &nbsp; one &nbsp; H</h2>
          <p>Check your reporting. You should strive to answer the 5 W<span class="nocaps">s</span> and one H through your research and observations.
          <br><strong>Who</strong>: Students and schools / <strong>What</strong>: Breakfast / <strong>When</strong>: Mornings on school days / <strong>Where</strong>: All schools / <strong>Why</strong>: Increased health and academic performance / <strong>How</strong>: Budget and schedule shifts<br>
          Put your researched answers to all questions into sentence form, and use them in your argument. </p>

    <div class="grid">
    <figure class="effect-bubba">

        <figcaption>
          <h2>Reader &nbsp; Interest</h2> 
          <p>Use details that your audience will find interesting. In your research and interviews, you will likely notice a “human interest” element or a surprising statistic. Include this in your argument if it fits with your writing style, and your readers will pay close attention! 
          <br><br><em>Example:</em> Joey hasn’t had breakfast in two years. “It’s not so bad until I get to third period,” he said. “That’s when I’m so hungry I can’t concentrate at all.”</p>

        <figcaption>
          <h2>Offer &nbsp; Suggestions</h2>       
          <p>Let your conclusion show audiences what they can do next. You might offer suggestions for how the problem can be resolved, or you might leave readers with something to think about. Try to do more than simply point out a problem; show readers how they can start to fix that problem. </p>
