<h1>Arguments</h1>
<p>There’s a difference between arguing your point and just ranting at someone who upset you. </p>
<p>A rant usually doesn’t make much sense, but it's loud and filled with emotion. This isn’t the best way to get people to listen. </p>
<p>A strong argument is the best method to bring people to your side. Think of this like a debate you take the time to write. It’s rational and well thought out. Most importantly, it addresses both sides of the issue fairly. </p>
<p>First, an argument makes a <strong>claim</strong>. This is your point. </p>

<p>Then an argument acknowledges the <strong>counterclaim</strong>. This is a fair explanation of what people might say is wrong with your argument. </p>


<img src="images/04_02_02_image2_ts.png" alt="Image of a condemned building. A protester sign in front reads &quot;Save this building!&quot;. A second sign is saying &quot;This building is dangerous, and it is an eyesore. It should be torn down.&quot; " class="pull-left">

<p>Finally, an argument provides a <strong>rebuttal</strong> to the counterclaim. This is a response to the counterclaim you provided. It leaves your audience with a clear path to understanding your point and joining your cause. </p>

A second sign is saying &quot;This building is dangerous, and it is an eyesore. It should be torn down.&quot; " class="pull-left"> 

<p>Following this structure, you can write an argument that demonstrates you've thought through all the potential problems, and tells your readers that your opinion is the one they should adopt. </p>

<h1>Arguments in Journalism</h1>
<p>While many journalists try to avoid showing opinion in their reporting, sometimes plain facts aren’t enough to get across the important details that will help audiences understand. This is when opinion writing can be useful.</p>



<p>Editorial writers are one example of journalists who use opinion in their writing. These writers create an argument in hopes of swaying public opinion, making people think, and perhaps even calling the public to action. However, even though it’s opinion writing, you still must remember to include researched reporting! This will give you the credibility you need to get your message across successfully. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how a journalist might use <strong>claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal:</strong></p>

        <div class="panel-body">
         
          <p>Forms the foundation of the argument</p>
          <p><em>Example:</em> "Contrary to what today's TV ratings may indicate, the NFL is not too big to fail, especially if its darker side continues to gain the upper hand."</p>

                     <ul><li>Opposing viewpoint; disagrees with the claim</li>
         <li> <strong>Not</strong> the focus of the argument, but should be mentioned briefly</li></ul>
         <p> <em>Example:</em> "At its best, football brings individuals and communities together, reuniting old friends and introducing new ones in ways that strengthen the social fabric. And some players and coaches truly are exemplary public figures and community leaders."</p>

      <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
                     <ul><li>Facts, findings, or experiences </li>
<li>Logically supports the claim or refutes the counterclaim</li></ul>
         <p> <em>Example:</em> "Since January 2000, there have been 732 arrests (involving 539 NFL players) in connection with various crimes ranging from disorderly conduct to murder."</p>

<p>Remember, when you’re writing an editorial piece, you aren’t always writing to the people who already agree with you. To be truly effective, an argument should make people on the other side think about what they believe. The more you can be honest about counterclaims, the more likely your opposition will be to listen to you. </p><div class="well infobox">

        <h2>Expert's Corner</h2>
        <p>Many journalism organizations agree that the journalists who share their opinion should not be the same journalists who write impartial stories for the traditional news sections. This is likely to confuse audiences about what is fact and what is opinion. To keep everything clear, many news organizations keep opinion writing separate from news stories that are meant to be neutral. </p>
