<h1>Opinion Writing</h1>
<p>Take a look at this example of an editorial that appeared in the <em>Star Tribune</em>, Minneapolis, Minnesota, in September of 2014. Can you find the claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal? </p>

<div class="mainVersion">
<div class="paperlook">
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
    	<p><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="Here the writer states the claim: it is a good thing that more people are aware of the problems in the NFL." data-trigger="hover">If there's an upside to the Adrian Peterson situation, or, for that matter, to the seemingly endless police blotter of NFL players arrested in connection with domestic violence, aggravated assault, drunken driving, drug and gun violations, and other serious offenses, it is this: More people are seeing the NFL with eyes wide open, and that's a good thing. </a></p>
        <p><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="Notice that the writer provides researched reporting here and in other places throughout the editorial. This brings credibility to the argument. There is also a strong amount of information here that's positive about the NFL, even though the piece is critical of the league. This is part of the counterclaim, showing what the NFL has done for the country that has been good." data-trigger="hover">It's not that professional football is without value to society or the economy. The game has, over the last five decades, embedded itself into the national character to the point that it defines Sunday afternoon (not to mention Sunday, Thursday and Monday nights) in tens of millions of homes. Two-thirds of Americans watch the games on TV. Having an NFL team heightens your city's identity, and the economic spillover is considerable. The league generates nearly $10 billion a year, making it the world's most successful sports enterprise.</a></p>
        <p><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="This is another statement that backs up the counterclaim: there are many good people associated with the NFL. This makes it clear the writer is not trying to 'bash' everyone who plays football or works with football teams." data-trigger="hover">At its best, football brings individuals and communities together, reuniting old friends and introducing new ones in ways that strengthen the social fabric. And some players and coaches truly are exemplary public figures and community leaders.</a></p>
        <p><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="Here the writer has restated and clarified the claim: Because people are paying close attention to the NFL's problems, the NFL will eventually lose popularity if it doesn't stop its players from doing bad things." data-trigger="hover">But contrary to what today's TV ratings may indicate, the NFL is not too big to fail, especially if its darker side continues to gain the upper hand.</a> </p>
        <p>Since January 2000, there have been 732 arrests (involving 539 NFL players) in connection with various crimes ranging from disorderly conduct to murder. That's out of a pool of 1,700 players at any given moment. Over that span of years, the Vikings have led the league in arrested players &mdash; 44.</p>
    
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
    	<p><a class="popover" data-position="bottom" data-content="This part of the editorial provides more researched reporting to support the writer's claim. The information responds to the counterclaim by showing that, even though there are many positive details about the NFL, there is still a large percentage of people&mdash;mostly players&mdash;who are contributing to the problems the writer is addressing. This is the rebuttal." data-trigger="hover">That's a scandalous amount of police activity for a team and for a league that tries to portray all of its players as model citizens.</a></p>
        <p>But how to crack down? The NFL and its teams face a conundrum. Theirs is a violent game, and getting more so. The increase over the years in velocity and physical impact has been remarkable. Players are handsomely rewarded for the violence they inflict and absorb. It's not surprising, then, that among those people who football attracts are those who may find it difficult to turn off the violence and intimidation when dealing with ordinary life. </p>
        <p><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="Toward the end of many editorials, the writer will address what is causing the problem, what will happen if no one does anything, and then how the problem might be fixed. Here the writer acknowledges that correcting the problem is difficult, but points out that soon football may be a sport few people like to watch because it's associated with disturbing violence." data-trigger="hover">Every NFL team has its share of bad actors. The basic problem is that high moral character doesn't win football games. As long as winning at any cost remains the overwhelming priority, the game will continue its downward slide. Women will continue to turn away. More and more families will forbid sons to play football. The NFL will become eventually a base amusement for society's lowest rung. Commissioner Roger Goodell should remember that the sport of boxing once held mass appeal.</a></p>
        <p>For the NFL to sustain its popularity, Goodell, team owners and the players association should convene a blue-ribbon commission to establish a fair, consistent and transparent set of behavior standards. It should be clear to everyone what actions the league will take when a player is charged, when he's indicted and when he's convicted.</p>
        <p><a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="This is the conclusion, where the writer provides a suggestion for ways to improve the NFL's image. This is a good way to bring an editorial to an end because it does more than just point out a problem; it offers solutions" data-trigger="hover">Standards should be augmented by rigorous education on what it means to be a public figure and a solid citizen. Salary structures and player evaluations should include components that reward good character.</a> </p>

<p>Did you notice the way the writer ended this editorial? After presenting the claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal, the writer went on to address three important details:</p>
<ul><li>What is causing the problem</li>
<li>What might happen if no one stops it</li>
<li>How the problem can be resolved</li></ul>

<p>This structure allows an opinion writer to accomplish three important things:</p>

	<img src="images/04_02_03_checklist_ts.png" alt="<ol><li>Get people to think about the topic</li>
<li>Inform people about the topic with strong reporting </li>
<li>Offer a suggestion for what people should do or believe by the end </li></ol>" class="pull-left" >

<p>These are the basics of presenting a strong argument in the news. Just as there are many examples of careers in impartial journalism, there are also many different types of jobs for opinion writers. From movie reviews to sports coverage to political commentary, opinion news strives to provide a clear look at various topics in different ways. This structure will help you create the basic framework for your own editorial piece. </p>
