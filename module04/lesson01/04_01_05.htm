<h1>Ethos  </h1>

<p>Writing with <strong>ethos</strong> means writing with values or <strong>ethics</strong> in mind. This is the final key factor in any strong argument. By using ethos, the writer is trying to appeal to his or her audience on an ethical level, showing an understanding about what the community values.<br></p><img src="images/04_01_05_ethos_ts.png" alt=""><br>
<p>As human beings, we often <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Gravitate:</strong> To be naturally attracted to" data-position="top">gravitate</span> toward people who agree with us on <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Fundamental:</strong> Core" data-position="top">fundamental</span>, as well as trivial, issues. For instance, if you’re a gamer who feels strongly that the PS4™ is the best console, you may tend to associate with friends who also play PlayStation video games. If you and your family are strongly against <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Capital Punishment:</strong> Execution" data-position="top">capital punishment</span> for ethical reasons, then you may appreciate the company of other people who feel the same way.</p>
<p>To gain your trust, many people and organizations will try to appeal to your sense of right and wrong. This is known as an appeal to ethos. </p>
<p>When covering a news story, you may find that your own ethics make you want to slant the news by sharing only information that supports your side. Reporters must be careful to share all sides of every story, even when they have personal feelings about the topic. This is the best way to be credible and useful to the public. </p>
<p>However, journalists are not robots! They have feelings and beliefs just like anyone else. When tragedy strikes, or when another country is at war with our own, it may be difficult for journalists to keep an objective stance on issues. </p>
<p>Listen to this segment about what happens when journalists get involved in the stories they cover: </p>

<h1>Just the Facts</h1>
<p>When the people who are supposed to be impartial sometimes express opinion based on their personal ethos, how can you tell the difference between fact and opinion?</p>
<p>This is when it’s important to think like a journalist! Most reporters check their own facts, and news organizations employ fact checkers who double and triple check everything after them. However, opinions can still slip through once in a while. In order to tell what’s credible news and what isn’t, you must learn to check the facts.</p>

      <ul><li>Consider the source. Is the source credible?</li>
    <li>  Be aware of any agenda the reporter, publisher, or producer may have.</li>
<li>If a fact surprises you, look it up. Do your findings match the reporter’s findings?</li>
<li>Always get information from both sides of any debate before making up your own mind.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> When a reporter states what other people feel, this doesn’t necessarily mean the reporter feels the same way. </p>
<p>Consider the following statistic:</p>
<blockquote>
   <p>The president of the United States has a 70 percent approval rating, but half of Americans still say they want to see the president wearing more silly shoes.</p>

</blockquote>  
<p>If a reporter says these words, this does not mean that he or she approves of the president or cares about silly shoes. It simply means the reporter is sharing information about what the public feels.</p>
