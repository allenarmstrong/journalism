	<p>News writers have to be careful to maintain credibility. Even if your work is based on opinion, you must present clear messages that do not attempt to manipulate people without their knowing. There are many ways to evoke strong emotions in people, and ethical news organizations do this openly and honestly so there is never any confusion about what is fact and what is opinion.</p>
