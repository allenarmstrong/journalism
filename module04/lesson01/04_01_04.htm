   <h1>Logos</h1>
<p>Using logos <strong>(think "logic")</strong> means appealing to reason. This is a key factor in any strong argument because it provides a logical explanation to the readers.</p>

        <h2>Expert's Corner</h2>An editorial writer himself, Mike Thomas talked about the value of sharing opinion in the news industry. He feels that a good columnist should <blockquote>"back up your argument with a good presentation of the facts so people aren't only getting an opinion; they're getting an education. And then, even if they chose not to agree with you, you've presented them with new material."</blockquote> </div> </div>
        

<p>Statistics and sources normally lend credibility to information in a news story. Quoting a source and including specific percentages to back up your argument are examples of an appeal to logos. This supports your research with logical evidence. </p>   
<p>Although logic seems like it should be straightforward, sometimes it’s tricky. </p>
<p>Often people don’t bother to check the “facts” they read. As a result, they may make incorrect assumptions about things. This kind of problem is known as a logical <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Fallacy:</strong> A mistaken belief founded on inaccuracies and unsound logic" data-position="top"> fallacy</span>. </p>
<p>Common problems such as racism and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Groupthink:</strong> The practice of making decisions as a group, which discourages creativity and avoids personal responsibility" data-position="top">groupthink</span> are often products of logical fallacies. Some fallacies occur because people are misinformed or misunderstand information. Other fallacies occur because someone is deliberately trying to fool other people. </p>
<p>If you have ever felt that a person’s “logical” conclusion did not make complete sense, it’s possible he or she was guilty of a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Logical Fallacy:</strong> Flaw or mistake in logic" data-position="top">logical fallacy</span>. 
Here are three common fallacies that journalists see on a regular basis. Have you ever experienced them before?</p>

           <p>Bandwagon is a logical fallacy that relies on what the majority of people think. You may have heard the phrase “Everybody’s doing it” when someone wants you to make a difficult decision. This is the bandwagon fallacy. Simply because “everybody” likes something (or, more likely, many people do) does not mean it is a good thing to do. Your best bet is to do some research to determine what the benefits and drawbacks are of joining with the group.</p>

      <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          
           <p>False dilemma is a logical fallacy that incorrectly suggests there are only two options available. You may have heard someone say, “You can either do A or do B,” when neither option is one you like. This is usually a false dilemma fallacy. The person has implied that you have no other option but to do either A or B. Many times there is an option C (and D, and E, and F … ) that the person is not mentioning. Your best bet is to do some research on what you really can and cannot do in the situation before you make a final decision.</p>

      <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
           <p>Correlation and causation (also sometimes known as post hoc) is a combination of logical fallacies that do similar things. You’ll often hear people talk about the relationship between two facts, sometimes suggesting that one caused the other. This is where you might run into the fallacy of correlation and causation. Two things might have a lot in common, or they might even happen for the same reasons. However, it is easy to decide that because things are similar, one must have caused the other to happen. This is not always the case. Your best bet is to examine each situation to determine what the true backgrounds are for each one.</p>
