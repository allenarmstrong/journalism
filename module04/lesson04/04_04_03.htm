<h1>Quotations</h1>
<p>Including a quotation from a source can be useful when you want to express an idea with credibility. If an expert can sum up an important fact, you include a quotation to show your audience that you’ve done your research. </p>
<p>There’s a specific way to format quotations in your writing. </p>
<p>First, make sure your audience knows who is talking. You can do this with <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Signal words and phrases: </strong> Phrases such as &quot;President Obama said&quot; or &quot;According to the Secretary of State&quot; that signal to your audience that you are quoting someone else" data-position="top">signal words and phrases</span>. </p>
<p>Second, include the writer’s or speaker’s <strong>exact words</strong> in quotation marks. If the quotation comes at the end of the sentence, the period (or other ending punctuation) should appear inside the quotation marks. </p>
<p>Finally, follow up on the quote to help your audience understand what it means or why you included it. </p>
<p>Take a look at this example: </p>

   <img src="images/04_04_03_quote1_ts.png" 
	alt="… when there's an accident involving a rocket, … the question comes up as to how such a thing can happen.
Virgin Atlantic chief Richard Branson expressed shock at the crash but vowed to push on.
&#39;Space is hard – but worth it. We will persevere and move forward together,&#39; Branson said.
Admirable, to be sure, but is it really achievable in the long run? First sentence introduces the quotation. Second sentence is a direct quotation, ending with a comma to set the quote apart and a signal to let the reader know who said the quote. "
 
	class="center-block" 
    data-width=""
    data-copyright=""> 
    <p>Note that the writer used the quotation in the example to move on to the main idea of the editorial.</p>
