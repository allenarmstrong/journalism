<h1>What&#39;s Already Been Said? </h1>
<p>Chances are you won’t be the first person to write about your topic. That’s okay! However, you do want to find out what other people have said and what important information is out there. </p>
There are three good reasons to do thorough research for your editorial:
<ul><li>The more you know about your topic, the better you can support your claim. </li>
<li>When you research opposing viewpoints, you’ll know exactly what to say about the counterclaim. </li>
<li>Strong evidence from credible sources will help you create a rebuttal that people will believe. </li></ul>

<p>Use this checklist to guide your research: </p>
<div id="clipboard">    <div>

<p>I have searched online for articles or videos about my topic. </p>
<p>I have contacted experts on both sides of the issue about my topic to ask them for more information. </p>
<p>I have searched through archived information (online or at a library) to find a brief history of this topic. </p>
<p>I have found primary source information about my topic. This may include speeches, official reports, government documents, and statistics. </p>
<p>I have double-checked all of my sources to be sure they are reliable and trustworthy. </p>
</div>

<p>Remember: the more you know, the stronger your editorial will be!</p>

    
    <h1>5Ws and One H</h1>
<p>Journalists live by the 5Ws and one H: <strong>W</strong>ho, <strong>W</strong>hat, <strong>W</strong>hen, <strong>W</strong>here, <strong>W</strong>hy, and <strong>H</strong>ow. These are important in just about every form of journalism you can write, including opinion pieces. </p>
<p>As you do your research, search for answers to those questions. Here are some ways you can approach the 5Ws and one H in your editorial research:
