<h1>Claim, Counterclaim, and Rebuttal</h1>
<p>Has the speaker provided a claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal in his response? </p>

<div class="well default paddit"><img src="images/interview-1_ts.png" alt="" class="img-rounded pull-right"><p>Q: This week we are approaching the six-month mark since the President signed the health care legislation. And when he was talking to Democrats on the Hill about this legislation, he made a point of saying that this is something that you can be proud to campaign on come November. And we are not seeing hardly any Democrats that supported health care campaigning on that legislation. Why do you think that’s happening, and has the President asked them to do that now that we’re approaching --</p></div>

<div class="well default"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-2"><img src="images/interview-2_ts.png" alt="" class="img-rounded pull-left"></div><div class="col-md-10"><p>MR. GIBBS: No, the President is not directing the messaging or ads for individual candidates. Obviously they’ll do what they think and what they believe is best in terms of what they want to talk about in their districts. <a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="Notice that the speaker is addressing a slightly different topic. The journalist asked why supporters are not mentioning this legislation in their campaigns. The speaker is answering the question by stating his claim that these are “truly landmark reforms” that will provide “important protections.” In essence, the speaker is giving a speech that argues his point without directly answering the question. This is a common problem that journalists face when they ask people questions!" data-title="" data-trigger="hover">I think it’s important, as you mentioned, that we’re arriving at a point in which a number of the important consumer protections will kick in for health care, including important protections on preexisting conditions, which represent truly landmark reforms. </a> </p>

<p>Look, I don’t know -- again, <a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content=" Here the speaker addresses the question briefly by saying that “individual messaging” is up to the candidates. In a way, the counterclaim is the problem the journalist suggested with her question: that candidates are not fully supporting the legislation, or they are afraid to publicly announce their support." data-title="" data-trigger="hover">we’ll leave individual messaging decisions to individual candidates.</a>  But I think, as you see over the next -- the course of the next few days these consumer protections kick in, I think you will -- <a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="The speaker responds to the counterclaim here by saying that, even though both Democrats and Republicans may be expressing hesitation about the reform, he believes they will find that they are both getting what they wanted in the end." data-title="" data-trigger="hover">you will see and notice the type of protections that many Democrat and Republican had long wished for</a> -- that no longer can somebody be discriminated against simply because they’re sick. Those represent meaningful, tangible reforms for the people of this country. </p></div></div></div>

But I think people that supported this and <a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content=" Notice that the speaker is forced to give his rebuttal here, but he stays with his original focus. Rather than directly address the counterclaim by saying what message he thinks this sends, he talks about the accomplishment of the legislation and those who have supported it." data-title="" data-trigger="hover">the families that they are working to protect can and should be proud of the accomplishment.</a> </p></div></div></div>
