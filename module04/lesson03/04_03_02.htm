<h1>Press Briefing</h1>
<p>Journalists often attend press briefings, where politicians or other public figures offer official statements about current events. Sometimes these public figures take questions from the journalists, and they have to answer with short, <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Impromptu:</strong> On the spot, without much or any preparation" data-position="top">impromptu</span> speeches. </p>
<p>Though they’re answering these questions on the spot, the people holding press briefings usually have a good idea about what journalists are likely to ask them. As a result, many answers are pre-rehearsed and may include effective argument techniques. </p>
<p>Take a look at this video of a press briefing at the White House where a journalist asks about the lack of political backing for a controversial initiative. Do you notice any effective argument techniques being used? </p>

<h1>Logos, Pathos, Ethos</h1>
<p>Strong arguments typically include three appeals to reach their audience: logos, pathos, and ethos. Let’s look at the text of this impromptu speech to see whether the speaker has used these appeals. </p>

<div class="well default"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-2"><img src="images/interview-2_ts.png" alt="Image of Mr. Gibbs" class="img-rounded pull-left"></div><div class="col-md-10"><br><br><p>MR. GIBBS: Yes, ma'am.</p></div></div></div>

<div class="well default paddit"><img src="images/interview-1_ts.png" alt="" class="img-rounded pull-right"><p>Q: This week we are approaching the six-month mark since the President signed the health care legislation. And when he was talking to Democrats on the Hill about this legislation, he made a point of saying that this is something that you can be proud to campaign on come November. And we are not seeing hardly any Democrats that supported health care campaigning on that legislation. Why do you think that’s happening, and has the President asked them to do that now that we’re approaching --</p></div>

<div class="well default"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-2"><img src="images/interview-2_ts.png" alt="Image of Mr. Gibbs" class="img-rounded pull-left"></div><div class="col-md-10"><p>MR. GIBBS: <a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="This is an example of logos. The speaker addresses the logical details first, clarifying that the President is not in charge of candidates’ political advertising." data-title="" data-trigger="hover">No, the President is not directing the messaging or ads for individual candidates. Obviously they’ll do what they think and what they believe is best in terms of what they want to talk about in their districts.</a>  I think it’s important, as you mentioned, that we’re arriving at a point in which a number of the important consumer protections will kick in for health care, including important protections on preexisting conditions, which represent truly landmark reforms.</p>
<p>Look, I don’t know -- again, we’ll leave individual messaging decisions to individual candidates. But I think, as you see over the next -- the course of the next few days these consumer protections kick in, I think you will -- you will see and notice the type of protections that many Democrat and Republican had long wished for -- <a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="This is a clear example of a pre-rehearsed line in the argument that uses ethos. It appeals to a sense of ethics by using words such as “discriminated against” and “the people of this country.” People who hear these words are more likely to feel that the speaker understands their ethical values." data-title="" data-trigger="hover">that no longer can somebody be discriminated against simply because they’re sick. Those represent meaningful, tangible reforms for the people of this country.</a>   </p></div></div></div>

<div class="well default paddit"><img src="images/interview-1_ts.png" alt="" class="img-rounded pull-right"><br><p>Q: But does it send any message about this legislation that these candidates who actually came out and voted for it feel like they can’t campaign for it, that it’s a negative for them to campaign on it?</p><BR></div>

<div class="well default"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-2"><img src="images/interview-2_ts.png" alt="Image of Mr. Gibbs" class="img-rounded pull-left"></div><div class="col-md-10"><p>MR. GIBBS: I don’t think that’s necessarily the case, and, look, I turn on the TV all the time and see discussions on a large variety of topics that -- in the midst of political campaigns. But I think people that supported this and <a class="popover" data-position="top" data-content="Here the speaker uses pathos. He appeals to the emotions of the audience by referring to the families who need their protection. " data-title="" data-trigger="hover">the families that they are working to protect </a>can and should be proud of the accomplishment. </p></div></div></div>

<p>Even in this press briefing, the speaker was able to touch on all three appeals. Next, let’s see whether he was able to create a strong argument by establishing a claim, counterclaim, and rebuttal. </p>
