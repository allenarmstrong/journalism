<p>Press Briefing by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 9/21/2010<br />
  2:48 P.M. EDT<br />
  <br />
MR. GIBBS:  Yes, ma'am.<br />
<br />
Q    This week we are approaching the six-month mark since the President signed the health care legislation.  And when he was talking to Democrats on the Hill about this legislation, he made a point of saying that this is something that you can be proud to campaign on come November.  And we are not seeing hardly any Democrats that supported health care campaigning on that legislation.  Why do you think that's happening, and has the President asked them to do that now that we're approaching --<br />
<br />
MR. GIBBS:  No, the President is not directing the messaging or ads for individual candidates.  Obviously they'll do what they think and what they believe is best in terms of what they want to talk about in their districts.  I think it's important, as you mentioned, that we're arriving at a point in which a number of the important consumer protections will kick in for health care, including important protections on preexisting conditions, which represent truly landmark reforms.<br />
<br />
Look, I don't know -- again, we'll leave individual messaging decisions to individual candidates.  But I think, as you see over the next -- the course of the next few days these consumer protections kick in, I think you will -- you will see and notice the type of protections that many Democrat and Republican had long wished for -- that no longer can somebody be discriminated against simply because they're sick.  Those represent meaningful, tangible reforms for the people of this country.<br />
<br />
Q    But does it send any message about this legislation that these candidates who actually came out and voted for it feel like they can't campaign for it, that it's a negative for them to campaign on it?<br />
<br />
MR. GIBBS:  I don't think that's necessarily the case, and, look, I turn on the TV all the time and see discussions on a large variety of topics that -- in the midst of political campaigns.  But I think people that supported this and the families that they are working to protect can and should be proud of the accomplishment.</p>
