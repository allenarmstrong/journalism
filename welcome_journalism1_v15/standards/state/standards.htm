        <ul>
          <li>LAFS.910.RI.2.4 Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative, connotative, and technical meanings; analyze the cumulative impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone (e.g., how the language of a court opinion differs from that of a newspaper).</li>
          <li>LAFS.910.RI.4.10 By the end of grade 9, read and comprehend literary nonfiction in the grades 910 text complexity band proficiently, with scaffolding as needed at the high end of the range. By the end of grade 10, read and comprehend literary nonfiction at the high end of the grades 910 text complexity band independently and proficiently.</li>
          <li>LAFS.910.L.3.4 Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases based on grades 910 reading and content, choosing flexibly from a range of strategies. Use context (e.g., the overall meaning of a sentence, paragraph, or text; a words position or function in a sentence) as a clue to the meaning of a word or phrase. Identify and correctly use patterns of word changes that indicate different meanings or parts of speech (e.g., analyze, analysis, analytical; advocate, advocacy). Consult general and specialized reference materials (e.g., dictionaries, glossaries, thesauruses), both print and digital, to find the pronunciation of a word or determine or clarify its precise meaning, its part of speech, or its etymology. Verify the preliminary determination of the meaning of a word or phrase (e.g., by checking the inferred meaning in context or in a dictionary).</li>
          <li>LAFS.910.L.3.5 Demonstrate understanding of figurative language, word relationships, and nuances in word meanings. Interpret figures of speech (e.g., euphemism, oxymoron) in context and analyze their role in the text. Analyze nuances in the meaning of words with similar denotations.</li>
          <li>LAFS.910.RI.1.2 Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including how it emerges and is shaped and refined by specific details; provide an objective summary of the text.</li>
          <li>LAFS.910.RI.1.3 Analyze how the author unfolds an analysis or series of ideas or events, including the order in which the points are made, how they are introduced and developed, and the connections that are drawn between them.</li>
          <li>VA.912.H.1.5 Investigate the use of technology and media design to reflect creative trends in visual culture.</li>
          <li>VA.912.H.2.1 Identify transitions in art media, technique, and focus to explain how technology has changed art throughout history.</li>
          <li>LAFS.910.SL.1.1d Respond thoughtfully to diverse perspectives, summarize points of agreement and disagreement, and, when warranted, qualify or justify their own views and understanding and make new connections in light of the evidence and reasoning presented.</li>
          <li>LAFS.910.W.3.9 Draw evidence from literary or informational texts to support analysis, reflection, and research. Apply grades 910 Reading standards to literature (e.g., Analyze how an author draws on and transforms source material in a specific work [e.g., how Shakespeare treats a theme or topic from Ovid or the Bible or how a later author draws on a play by Shakespeare]). Apply grades 910 Reading standards to literary nonfiction (e.g., Delineate and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text, assessing whether the reasoning is valid and the evidence is relevant and sufficient; identify false statements and fallacious reasoning).</li>
          <li>        LAFS.910.SL.2.6 Adapt speech to a variety of contexts and tasks, demonstrating command of formal English when indicated or appropriate.</li>
